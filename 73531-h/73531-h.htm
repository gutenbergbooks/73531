<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>In all teaching of plants and animals to beginners, the
plants themselves and the animals themselves should be
made the theme, rather than any amount of definitions and
of mere study in books. Books will be very useful in
guiding the way, in arranging the subjects systematically,
and in explaining obscure points; but if the pupil does not
know the living and growing plants when he has completed
his course in botany, he has not acquired very much that
is worth the while.</p>

<p>It is well to acquaint the beginner at first with the main
features of the entire plant rather than with details of its
parts. He should at once form a mental picture of what
the plant is, and what are some of its broader adaptations
to the life that it leads. In this book, the pupil starts with
the entire branch or the entire plant. It is sometimes said
that the pupil cannot grasp the idea of struggle for existence
until he knows the names and the uses of the different
parts of the plant. This is an error, although well established
in present-day methods of teaching.</p>

<p>Another very important consideration is to adapt the
statement of any fact to the understanding of a beginner.
It is easy, for example, to fall into technicalities when discussing
osmosis; but the minute explanations would mean
nothing to the beginner and their use would tend to confuse
the picture which it is necessary to leave in the pupil’s
mind. Even the use of technical forms of expression would
probably not go far enough to satisfy the trained physicist.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi1">[vi]</span>
It is impossible ever to state the last thing about any
proposition. All knowledge is relative. What is very
elementary to one mind may be very technical and advanced
to another. It is neither necessary nor desirable
to safeguard statements to the beginner by such qualifications
as will make them satisfactory to the critical expert
in science. The teacher must understand that while
accuracy is always essential, the <i>degree of statement</i> is
equally important when teaching beginners.</p>

<p>The value of biology study lies in the work with the
actual objects. It is not possible to provide specimens for
every part of the work, nor is it always desirable to do so;
for the beginning pupil may not be able to interest himself
in the objects, and he may become immersed in details
before he has arrived at any general view or reason of the
subject. Great care must be exercised that the pupil is
not swamped. Mere book work or memory stuffing is
useless, and it may dwarf or divert the sympathies of
active young minds.</p>

<p>The present tendency in secondary education is away
from the formal technical completion of separate subjects
and toward the developing of a workable training in the
activities that relate the pupil to his own life. In the
natural science field, the tendency is to attach less importance
to botany and zoology as such, and to lay greater
stress on the processes and adaptations of life as expressed
in plants and animals. Education that is not applicable,
that does not put the pupil into touch with the living knowledge
and the affairs of his time, may be of less educative
value than the learning of a trade in a shop. We are beginning
to learn that the ideals and the abilities should be
developed out of the common surroundings and affairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii1">[vii]</span>
of life rather than imposed on the pupil as a matter of
abstract unrelated theory.</p>

<p>It is much better for the beginning pupil to acquire a
real conception of a few central principles and points of
view respecting common forms that will enable him to tie
his knowledge together and organize it and apply it, than
to familiarize himself with any number of mere facts about
the lower forms of life which, at the best, he can know
only indirectly and remotely. If the pupil wishes to go
farther in later years, he may then take up special groups
and phases.</p>

<p>If one compares <i>any two plants</i> of
the same kind ever so closely, it will be
found that they <i>differ from each other</i>. The
difference is apparent in size, form, colour, mode
of branching, number of leaves, number of flowers, vigour,
season of maturity, and the like; or, in other words, all
plants and animals <i>vary from an assumed or standard type</i>.</p>

<p>If one compares <i>any two branches or twigs</i> on a tree, it
will be found that they differ in size, age, form, vigour, and
in other ways (Fig. <a href="#fig1">1</a>).</p>

<p>If one compares <i>any two leaves</i>, it will be found that
they are unlike in size, shape, colour, veining, hairiness,
markings, cut of the margins, or other small features. In
some cases (as in Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a>) the differences are so great as to
be readily seen in a small black-and-white drawing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span></p>

<p>If the pupil extends his observation to animals, he
will still find the same truth; for probably <i>no two living
objects are exact duplicates</i>. If any person finds two objects
that he thinks to be exactly alike, let him set to work to
discover the differences, remembering that <i>nothing in
nature is so small or apparently trivial as to be overlooked</i>.</p>

<p><b>Variation</b>, or differences between organs and also between
organisms, is one of the most significant facts in
nature.</p>

<div class="sug">

<p><span class="smcap">Suggestions.</span>—The first fact that the pupil should acquire
about plants is that no two are alike. The way to apprehend this
great fact is to see a plant accurately and then to compare it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
another plant of the same species or kind. In order to direct and
concentrate the observation, it is well to set a certain number of
attributes or marks or qualities to be looked for. <b>1.</b> Suppose
any two or more plants of corn are compared in the following
points, the pupil endeavouring to determine whether the
parts exactly agree. See that the observation is close and
accurate. Allow no guesswork. Instruct the pupil to measure
the parts when size is involved.</p>

<p>(1) Height of the plant.</p>

<p>(2) Does it branch? How many secondary stems or “suckers”
from one root?</p>

<p>(3) Shade or colour.</p>

<p>(4) How many leaves.</p>

<p>(5) Arrangement of leaves on stem.</p>

<p>(6) Measure length and breadth of six main leaves.</p>

<p>(7) Number and position of ears; colour of silks.</p>

<p>(8) Size of tassel, and number and size of its branches.</p>

<p>(9) Stage of maturity or ripeness of plant.</p>

<p>(10) Has the plant grown symmetrically, or has it been crowded
by other plants or been obliged to struggle for light or room?</p>

<p>(11) Note all unusual or interesting marks or features.</p>

<p>(12) Always make note of comparative vigour of the plants.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note to Teacher.</span>—The teacher should always insist on <i>personal
work</i> by the pupil. Every pupil should <i>handle and study
the object by himself</i>. Books and pictures are merely guides and
helps. So far as possible, study the plant or animal <i>just where it
grows naturally</i>.</p>

<p><b>Notebooks.</b>—Insist that the pupils make full notes and preserve
these notes in suitable books. Note-taking is a powerful aid in
organizing the mental processes, and in insuring accuracy of observation
and record. The pupil should draw what he sees, even
though he is not expert with the pencil. The drawing should not
be made for looks, but to aid the pupil in his orderly study of the
object; it should be a means of self-expression.</p>

</div>


<p>Every plant and animal is <i>exposed to unfavourable conditions</i>.
It is obliged to contend with these conditions in
order to live.</p>

<p>No two plants or parts of plants are identically exposed
to the conditions in which they live. The large branches
in Fig. <a href="#fig1">1</a> probably had more room and a better exposure
to light than the smaller ones. Probably no two of the
leaves in Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a> are equally exposed to light, or enjoy
identical advantages in relation to the food that they receive
from the tree.</p>

<p>Examine any tree to determine under what advantages

similarly the different plants in a garden row (Fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a>); or
the different bushes in a thicket; or the different trees in

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span></p>

<p>The plant meets its conditions by <i>succumbing to them</i>
(that is, by dying), or by <i>adapting itself to them</i>.</p>

<p>The tree <i>meets the cold</i> by ceasing its active growth,
hardening its tissues, dropping its leaves. Many herbaceous
or soft-stemmed plants meet the cold by dying
to the ground and withdrawing all life into the root parts.
Some plants meet the cold by dying outright and providing
abundance of seeds to perpetuate the kind next season.</p>

</figure>

<p>Plants <i>adapt themselves to light</i> by growing toward it
(Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>); or by hanging their leaves in such position that
they catch the light; or, in less sunny places, by expanding
their leaf surface, or by greatly lengthening their
stems so as to overtop their fellows, as do trees and vines.</p>

<p>The adaptations of plants will afford a fertile field of
study as we proceed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<p><b>Struggle for existence</b> and <b>adaptation to conditions</b> are
among the most significant facts in nature.</p>

<p>The sum of all the conditions in which a plant or an animal
is placed is called its <b>environment</b>, that is, its surroundings.
The environment comprises the conditions of climate,
soil, moisture, exposure to light, relation to food supply,
contention with other plants or animals. <i>The organism
adapts itself to its environment, or else it weakens or dies.</i>
Every weak branch or plant has undergone some hardship
that it was not wholly able to withstand.</p>

<div class="sug">

<p><span class="smcap">Suggestions.</span>—The pupil should study any plant, or branch of a
plant, with reference to the position or condition under which it
grows, and compare one plant or branch with another. With animals,
it is common knowledge that every animal is alert to avoid or to
escape danger, or to protect itself. <b>2.</b> It is well to begin with a
branch of a tree, as in Fig. <a href="#fig1">1</a>. Note that no two parts are alike (Chap.
I). Note that some are large and strong and that these stand farthest
toward light and room. Some are very small and weak, barely
able to live under the competition. Some have died. The pupil can
easily determine which of the dead branches perished first. He should
take note of the position or place of the branch on the tree, and
determine whether the greater part of the dead twigs are toward the
centre of the tree top or toward the outside of it. Determine whether
accident has overtaken any of the parts. <b>3.</b> Let the pupil examine
the top of any thick old apple tree, to see whether there is any
struggle for existence and whether any limbs have perished. <b>4.</b> If
the pupil has access to a forest, let him determine why there are no
branches on the trunks of the old trees. Examine a tree of the
same kind growing in an open field. <b>5.</b> A row of lettuce or other
plants sown thick will soon show the competition between plants.
Any fence row or weedy place will also show it. Why does the
farmer destroy the weeds among the corn or potatoes? How does
the florist reduce competition to its lowest terms? what is the result?</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">THE SURVIVAL OF THE FIT</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The plants that most perfectly meet their conditions are
able to persist. <i>They perpetuate themselves.</i> Their offspring
are likely to inherit some of the attributes that
enabled them successfully to meet the battle of life. <i>The
fit</i> (those best adapted to their conditions) <i>tend to survive</i>.</p>

<p>Adaptation to conditions depends on the fact of variation;
that is, if plants were perfectly rigid or invariable
(all exactly alike) they could not meet new conditions.
Conditions are necessarily new for every organism. <i>It is
impossible to picture a perfectly inflexible and stable succession
of plants or animals.</i></p>

<p><b>Breeding.</b>—<i>Man is able to modify plants and animals.</i>
All our common domestic animals are very unlike their
original ancestors. So all our common and long-cultivated
plants have varied
from their ancestors. Even
in some plants that have
been in cultivation less than
a century the change is
marked: compare the common
black-cap raspberry
with its common wild ancestor,
or the cultivated blackberry
with the wild form.</p>

Every pupil
should undertake
at least
one simple experiment
in selection
of seed. He may select kernels from the
best plant of corn in the field, and also from the
poorest plant,—having reference not so much to
mere incidental size and vigour of the plants that
may be due to accidental conditions in the field,
as to the apparently constitutional strength and
size, number of ears, size of ears, perfectness of
ears and kernels, habit of the plant as to suckering,
and the like. The seeds may be saved and
sown the next year. Every crop can no doubt
be very greatly improved by a careful process
of selection extending over a series of years.
Crops are increased in yield or efficiency in three
ways: better general care; enriching the land in
which they grow; attention to breeding.</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">PLANT SOCIETIES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In the long course of time in which plants have been
accommodating themselves to the varying conditions in
which they are obliged to grow, <i>they have become adapted
to every different environment</i>. Certain plants, therefore,
may live together or near each other, all enjoying the
same general conditions and surroundings. These aggregations
of plants that are adapted to similar general conditions
are known as <b>plant societies</b>.</p>

<p>Moisture and temperature are the leading factors in
determining plant societies. The great geographical
societies or aggregations of the plant world may conveniently
be associated chiefly with the moisture supply,
as: <i>wet-region societies</i>, comprising aquatic and bog
vegetation (Fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a>); <i>arid-region societies</i>, comprising desert
and most sand-region vegetation; <i>mid-region societies</i>,
comprising the mixed vegetation in intermediate regions
(Fig. <a href="#fig9">9</a>), this being the commonest type. Much of the
characteristic scenery of any place is due to its plant
societies. Arid-region plants usually have small and hard
leaves, apparently preventing too rapid loss of water.
Usually, also, they are characterized by stiff growth, hairy
covering, spines, or a much-contracted plant body, and
often by large underground parts for the storage of water.</p>

<p>Plant societies may also be distinguished with reference
to latitude and temperature. There are <i>tropical societies</i>,
<i>temperate-region societies</i>, <i>boreal</i> or <i>cold-region societies</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
With reference to altitude, societies might be classified
as <i>lowland</i> (which are chiefly wet-region), <i>intermediate</i>
(chiefly mid-region), <i>subalpine</i> or <i>mid-mountain</i> (which are
chiefly boreal), <i>alpine</i> or <i>high-mountain</i>.</p>

<p>The above classifications have reference chiefly to great
geographical floras or societies. But there are <i>societies
within societies</i>. There are small societies coming within
the experience of every person who has ever seen plants
growing in natural conditions. There are roadside, fence-row,
lawn, thicket, pasture, dune, woods, cliff, barn-yard
societies. <i>Every different place has its characteristic vegetation.</i>
Note the smaller societies in Figs. <a href="#fig8">8</a> and <a href="#fig9">9</a>. In the
former is a water-lily society and a cat-tail society. In
the latter there are grass and bush and woods societies.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.—A Wet-region Society.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Some Details of Plant Societies.</b>—Societies may be composed
of <i>scattered and intermingled plants</i>, or of dense
<i>clumps</i> or <i>groups of plants</i>. Dense clumps or groups are
usually made up of one kind of plant, and they are then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
called <b>colonies</b>. Colonies of most plants are transient:
after a short time other plants gain a foothold amongst
them, and an intermingled society is the outcome. Marked
exceptions to this are grass colonies and forest colonies, in
which one kind of plant may hold its own for years and
centuries.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="fig9">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig9.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.—A Mid-region Society.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In a large newly cleared area, plants usually <i>first establish
themselves in dense colonies</i>. Note the great patches
of nettles, jewel-weeds, smart-weeds, clot-burs, fire-weeds
in recently cleared but neglected swales, also the fire-weeds
in recently burned areas, the rank weeds in the neglected
garden, and the ragweeds and May-weeds along the recently
worked highway. The competition amongst themselves
and with their neighbours finally breaks up the
colonies, and <i>a mixed and intermingled flora is generally
the result</i>.</p>

<p>In many parts of the world the <i>general tendency of neglected
areas is to run into forest</i>. All plants rush for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
cleared area. Here and there bushes gain a foothold.
Young trees come up; in time these shade the bushes and
gain the mastery. Sometimes the area grows to poplars
or birches, and people wonder why the original forest trees
do not return; but these forest trees may be growing unobserved
here and there in the tangle, and in the slow processes
of time the poplars perish—for they are short-lived—and
the original forest may be replaced. Whether one
kind of forest or another returns will depend partly on the
kinds that are most seedful in that vicinity and which,
therefore, have sown themselves most profusely. Much
depends, also, on the kind of undergrowth that first springs
up, for some young trees can endure more or less shade
than others.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp60" id="fig10">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig10.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.—Overgrowth and Undergrowth in
Three Series</span>,—trees, bushes, grass.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some plants <i>associate</i>. They grow together. This is
possible largely because they diverge or differ in character.
Plants associate
in two ways:
<i>by growing side by
side</i>; <i>by growing
above or beneath</i>.
In sparsely populated
societies,
plants may grow
alongside each
other. In most
cases, however,
there is <i>overgrowth</i>
and <i>undergrowth</i>:
one kind grows beneath another. Plants that have become
adapted to shade are usually undergrowths. In a cat-tail
swamp, grasses and other narrow-leaved plants grow
in the bottom, but they are usually unseen by the casual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
observer. Note the undergrowth in woods or under trees
(Fig. <a href="#fig10">10</a>). Observe that in pine and spruce forests there
is almost no undergrowth, partly because there is very little
light.</p>

<p>On the same area the societies may <i>differ at different
times of the year</i>. There are spring, summer, and fall societies.
The knoll which is cool with grass and strawberries
in June may be aglow with goldenrod in September.
If the bank is examined in May, look for the young plants
that are to cover it in July and October; if in September,
find the dead stalks of the flora of May. What succeeds
the skunk cabbage, hepaticas, trilliums, phlox, violets,
buttercups of spring? What precedes the wild sunflowers,
ragweed, asters, and goldenrod of fall?</p>

<p><b>The Landscape.</b>—To a large extent the <i>colour of the landscape</i>
is determined by the character of the plant societies.
Evergreen societies remain green, but the shade of green
varies from season to season; it is bright and soft in
spring, becomes dull in midsummer and fall, and assumes
a dull yellow-green or a black-green in winter. Deciduous
societies vary remarkably in colour—from the dull browns
and grays of winter to the brown greens and olive-greens
of spring, the staid greens of summer, and the brilliant
colours of autumn.</p>

<p>The <i>autumn colours</i> are due to intermingled shades of
green, yellow and red. The coloration varies with the kind
of plant, the special location, and the season. Even in the
same species or kind, individual plants differ in colour; and
this individuality usually <ins class="corr" id="distinguishes" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: dstinguishes">distinguishes</ins> the plant year by
year. That is, an oak which is maroon red this autumn is
likely to exhibit that range of colour every year. The autumn
colour is associated with the natural maturity and
death of the leaf, but it is most brilliant in long and open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
falls—largely because the foliage ripens more gradually
and persists longer in such seasons. It is probable that
the autumn tints are of no utility to the plant. <i>Autumn
colours are not caused by frost.</i> Because of the long, dry
falls and the great variety of plants, the autumnal colour of
the American landscape is phenomenal.</p>

<p><b>Ecology.</b>—The study of the relationships of plants and
animals to each other and to seasons and environments is
known as <b>ecology</b> (still written <i>œcology</i> in the dictionaries).
It considers the habits, habitats, and modes of life of living
things—the places in which they grow, how they
migrate or are disseminated, means of collecting food,
their times and seasons of flowering, producing young,
and the like.</p>

<div class="sug">

<p><span class="smcap">Suggestions.</span>—One of the best of all subjects for school instruction
in botany is the study of plant societies. It adds definiteness
and zest to excursions. <b>7.</b> Let each excursion be confined to one
or two societies. Visit one day a swamp, another day a forest,
another a pasture or meadow, another a roadside, another a weedy
field, another a cliff or ravine. Visit shores whenever possible.
Each pupil should be assigned a bit of ground—say 10 or 20 ft.
square—for special study. He should make a list showing (1)
how many kinds of plants it contains, (2) the relative abundance
of each. The lists secured in different regions should be compared.
It does not matter greatly if the pupil does not know all
the plants. He may count the kinds without knowing the names.
It is a good plan for the pupil to make a dried specimen of each
kind for reference. The pupil should endeavour to discover why
the plants grow as they do. Note what kinds of plants grow next
each other; and which are undergrowth and which overgrowth;
and which are erect and which wide-spreading. <i>Challenge every
plant society.</i></p>

<span class="chapt_sub">THE PLANT BODY</span></h2>
</div>


<p><b>The Parts of a Plant.</b>—Our familiar plants are made up
of several distinct parts. The most prominent of these
parts are <i>root, stem, leaf, flower, fruit, and seed. Familiar
plants differ wonderfully in size and shape</i>,—from fragile
mushrooms, delicate waterweeds and pond-scums, to floating
leaves, soft grasses, coarse weeds, tall bushes, slender
climbers, gigantic trees, and hanging moss.</p>

<p><b>The Stem Part.</b>—In most plants there is a <i>main central
part or shaft</i> on which the other or <i>secondary parts</i> are
borne. This main part is the <b>plant axis</b>. Above ground,
in most plants, the main plant axis bears the <i>branches</i>,
<i>leaves</i>, and <i>flowers</i>; below ground, it bears the <i>roots</i>.</p>

<p>The rigid part of the plant, which persists over winter
and which is left after leaves and flowers are fallen, is the
<b>framework</b> of the plant. The framework is composed of
both root and stem. When the plant is dead, the framework
remains for a time, but it slowly decays. The dry
winter stems of weeds are the framework, or skeleton of
the plant (Figs. <a href="#fig11_12">11 and 12</a>). The framework of trees is
the most conspicuous part of the plant.</p>

<p><b>The Root Part.</b>—The root bears the stem at its apex,
but otherwise it normally <i>bears only root-branches</i>. The
stem, however, <i>bears leaves, flowers, and fruits</i>. Those
living surfaces of the plant which are most exposed to
light are <i>green or highly coloured</i>. The root tends to grow
<i>downward</i>, but the stem tends to grow <i>upward toward light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and air</i>. The plant is anchored or fixed in the soil by the
roots. Plants have been called “earth parasites.”</p>

<p><b>The Foliage Part.</b>—The <i>leaves precede the flowers</i> in
point of time or life of the plant. <i>The flowers always
precede the fruits and seeds.</i> Many plants die when the
seeds have matured. The whole mass of leaves of any
plant or any branch is
known as its <i>foliage.</i>
In some cases, as in
crocuses, the flowers
seem to precede the
leaves; but the leaves
that made the food for
these flowers grew the
preceding year.</p>

<p><b>The Plant Generation.</b>—The
course of a
plant’s life, with all the
events through which
the plant naturally
passes, is known as
the plant’s <b>life-history</b>.
The life-history embraces
various stages,
or epochs, as <i>dormant
seed</i>, <i>germination</i>, <i>growth</i>, <i>flowering</i>, <i>fruiting</i>. Some plants
run their course in a few weeks or months, and some live
for centuries.</p>

<p>The entire life period of a plant is called a <b>generation</b>.
It is the whole period from birth to normal death, without
reference to the various stages or events through which it
passes.</p>

<p>A generation begins with <i>the young seed</i>, not with germination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
<i>It ends with death</i>—that is, when no life is left
in any part of the plant, and only the seed or spore
remains to perpetuate the kind. In a bulbous plant, as a
lily or an onion, the generation does not end until the bulb
dies, even though the top is dead.</p>

<p>When the generation is of only one season’s duration,
the plant is said to be <b>annual</b>. When it is of two seasons,
it is <b>biennial</b>. Biennials usually bloom the second year.
When of three or more seasons, the plant is <b>perennial</b>.
Examples of annuals are pigweed, bean, pea, garden sunflower;
of biennials, evening primrose, mullein, teasel; of
perennials, dock, most meadow grasses, cat-tail, and all
shrubs and trees.</p>

<p><b>Duration of the Plant Body.</b>—Plant structures which
are more or less soft and which die at the close of the
season are said to be <b>herbaceous</b>, in contradistinction to
being <b>ligneous</b> or <b>woody</b>. A plant which is herbaceous to
the ground is called an <b>herb</b>; but an herb may have a
woody or perennial root, in which case it is called an
<b>herbaceous perennial</b>. Annual plants are classed as herbs.
Examples of herbaceous perennials are buttercups, bleeding
heart, violet, water-lily, Bermuda grass, horse-radish,
dock, dandelion, goldenrod, asparagus, rhubarb, many
wild sunflowers (Figs. <a href="#fig11_12">11, 12</a>).</p>

<p>Many herbaceous perennials have <i>short generations</i>.
They become weak with one or two seasons of flowering
and gradually die out. Thus, red clover usually begins to
fail after the second year. Gardeners know that the best
bloom of hollyhock, larkspur, pink, and many other plants,
is secured when the plants are only two or three years
old.</p>

<p>Herbaceous perennials which die away each season to
bulbs or tubers, are sometimes called <b>pseud-annuals</b> (that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
is, <i>false annuals</i>). Of such are lily, crocus, onion, potato,

<p>True annuals reach old age the first year. Plants which
are normally perennial <i>may become annual in a shorter-season
climate by being killed by frost</i>, rather than by dying
naturally at the end of a season of growth. They are climatic
annuals. Such plants are called <b>plur-annuals</b> in the
short-season region. Many tropical perennials are plur-annuals
when grown in the north, but they are treated as
true annuals because they ripen sufficient of their crop the
same season in which the seeds are sown to make them
worth cultivating, as tomato, red pepper, castor bean,
cotton. Name several vegetables that are planted in
gardens with the expectation that they will bear till frost
comes.</p>

<p>The seed contains a <i>miniature plant</i>, or <b>embryo</b>. The
embryo usually has three parts that have received
names: the stemlet, or <b>caulicle</b>; the seed-leaf, or <b>cotyledon</b>
(usually 1 or 2); the bud, or <b>plumule</b>, lying between or
above the cotyledons. These parts are well
seen in the common bean (Fig. <a href="#fig15">15</a>), particularly
when the seed has been soaked for a
few hours. One of the large cotyledons—comprising
half of the bean—is shown at
<i>R</i>. The caulicle is at <i>O</i>. The plumule is
shown at <i>A</i>. The cotyledons are attached
to the caulicle at <i>F</i>: <i>this point may be taken

<p><b>The Number of Seed-leaves.</b>—All plants having <i>two
seed-leaves</i> belong to the group called <b>dicotyledons</b>. Such
seeds in many cases split readily in halves, <i>e.g.</i> a bean.
Some plants have only <i>one</i> seed-leaf in a seed. They
form a group of plants called <b>monocotyledons</b>. Indian
corn is an example of a plant with only one seed-leaf:
a grain of corn does not split into halves as a bean does.
Seeds of the pine family contain more than two cotyledons,
but for our purposes they may be associated with the dicotyledons,
although really forming a different group.</p>

<p>These two groups—the dicotyledons and the monocotyledons—represent
two great natural divisions of the
vegetable kingdom. The dicotyledons contain the woody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
bark-bearing trees and bushes (except conifers), and most
of the herbs of temperate climates except the grasses,
sedges, rushes, lily tribes, and orchids. The flower-parts
are usually in fives or multiples of five, the leaves mostly
netted-veined, the bark or rind distinct, and the stem often
bearing a pith at the centre. The monocotyledons usually
have the flower-parts in threes or multiples of three, the
leaves long and parallel-veined, the bark not separable,
and the stem without a central pith.</p>

</figure>

<p>Every seed is <i>provided with food</i> to support the germinating
plant. Commonly this food is starch. The food may
be stored <i>in the cotyledons</i>, as in bean, pea, squash; or <i>outside
the cotyledons</i>, as in castor bean, pine, Indian corn.
When the food is outside or around the embryo, it is
usually called <b>endosperm</b>.</p>

<p><b>Seed-coats; Markings on Seed.</b>—The embryo and endosperm
are inclosed within a covering made of two or
more layers and known as the <b>seed-coats</b>.
Over the point of the caulicle is a minute
hole or a thin place in the coats known as
the <b>micropyle</b>. This is the point at which
the pollen-tube entered the forming ovule
and through which the caulicle breaks in
germination. The micropyle is shown at <i>M</i> in Fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>.
The scar where the seed broke from its funiculus (or stalk
that attached it to its pod) is named the <b>hilum</b>. It occupies
a third of the length of the bean in Fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>. The
hilum and micropyle are always present in seeds, but they
are not always close together. In many cases it is difficult
to identify the micropyle in the dormant seed, but its location
is at once shown by the protruding caulicle as germination
begins. Opposite the micropyle in the bean (at the
other end of the hilum) is an elevation known as the <b>raphe</b>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
This is formed by a union of the funiculus, or seed-stalk,
with the seed-coats, and through it food was transferred
for the development of the seed, but it is now functionless.</p>

<p>Seeds differ wonderfully in size, shape, colour, and other
characteristics. They also vary in longevity. These
characteristics are <i>peculiar to the species or kind</i>. Some
seeds maintain life only a few weeks or even days, whereas
others will “keep” for ten or twenty years. In special
cases, seeds have retained vitality longer than this limit,
but the stories that live seeds, several thousand years old,
have been taken from the wrappings of mummies are unfounded.</p>

<p><b>Germination.</b>—The embryo is not dead; it is only dormant.
<i>When supplied with moisture, warmth, and oxygen
(air), it awakes and grows: this growth is</i> <b>germination</b>.
The embryo lives for a time on the stored food, but gradually
the plantlet secures a foothold in the soil and gathers
food for itself. <i>When the plantlet is finally able to shift
for itself, germination is complete.</i></p>

<p><b>Early Stages of Seedling.</b>—The germinating seed first
<i>absorbs water, and swells</i>. The starchy matters gradually
become soluble. The seed-coats are ruptured, the caulicle
and plumule emerge. During this process the seed
<i>respires freely, throwing off carbon dioxide</i> (CO<sub>2</sub>).</p>

  <figcaption class="caption caphang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.—Pea.</span> Grotesque forms assumed
when the roots cannot gain entrance to
the soil.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The caulicle usually elongates, and from its lower end
roots are emitted. The elongating caulicle is known as
the <b>hypocotyl</b> (“below the cotyledons”). That is, the
hypocotyl is that part of the stem of the plantlet lying
between the roots and the cotyledon. <i>The general direction
of the young hypocotyl, or emerging caulicle, is downwards.</i>
As soon as roots form, it becomes fixed and its
subsequent growth tends to raie the cotyledons above the
ground, as in the bean. When cotyledons rise into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
air, germination is said to be <b>epigeal</b> (“above the earth”).
Bean and pumpkin are examples. When the hypocotyl
does not elongate greatly
and the cotyledons remain
under ground, the germination
is <b>hypogeal</b> (“beneath
the earth”). Pea
and scarlet runner bean
are examples (Fig. <a href="#fig48">48</a>).
When the germinating
seed lies on a hard surface,
as on closely compacted
soil, the hypocotyl
and rootlets may not be able to secure a foothold and they
assume grotesque forms (Fig. <a href="#fig17">17</a>). Try this with peas and
beans.</p>

<p>The first internode (“between nodes”) above the cotyledons
is the <b>epicotyl</b>. It elevates the plumule into the
air, and <i>the plumule leaves expand into the first true leaves
of the plant</i>. These first true leaves, however, may be
very unlike the later leaves in shape.</p>

<p><b>Germination of Bean.</b>—The common bean, as we have
seen (Fig. <a href="#fig15">15</a>), has cotyledons that occupy all the space
inside the seed-coats. When the hypocotyl,
or elongated caulicle, emerges,
the plumule leaves have begun to enlarge,
and to unfold (Fig. <a href="#fig18">18</a>). The
hypocotyl elongates rapidly. One end
of it is held by the roots. The other
is held by the seed-coats in the soil.
It therefore takes the form of a loop,
and the central part of the loop “comes up” first (<i>a</i>, Fig.
<a href="#fig19">19</a>). Presently the cotyledons come out of the seed-coats,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
and the plant straightens and the
cotyledons expand. These cotyledons,
or “halves of the bean,”
persist for some time (<i>b</i>, Fig.
<a href="#fig19">19</a>). They often become green
and probably perform some
function of foliage. Because of
its large size, the Lima bean
shows all these parts well.</p>

<p><b>Germination of Castor Bean.</b>—In
the castor bean the hilum
and micropyle are at the smaller end
(Fig. <a href="#fig20">20</a>). The bean “comes up” with a
loop, which indicates that the hypocotyl
greatly elongates. On examining germinating
seed, however, it will be found
that the cotyledons are contained inside a fleshy body,
or sac (<i>a</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig21_22_23">21</a>). This sac is the endosperm. Against
its inner surface the thin, veiny cotyledons
are very closely pressed, absorbing
its substance (Fig. <a href="#fig21_22_23">22</a>). The cotyledons increase
in size as they reach the air (Fig. <a href="#fig21_22_23">23</a>), and become functional
leaves.</p>

<p><b>Germination of Monocotyledons.</b>—Thus far we have studied
dicotyledonous seeds; we may now consider the monocotyledonous
group. Soak kernels of corn. Note that
the micropyle and hilum are at the smaller end (Fig. <a href="#fig24_25_26">24</a>).
Make a longitudinal section through the
narrow diameter; Fig. <a href="#fig24_25_26">25</a> shows it. The
single cotyledon is at <i>a</i>, the caulicle at <i>b</i>, the plumule
at <i>p</i>. The cotyledon remains in the seed. The food is
stored both in the cotyledon and as endosperm, chiefly the
latter. The emerging shoot is the plumule, with a sheathing
leaf (<i>p</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig24_25_26">26</a>). The root is emitted from the tip of
the caulicle, <i>c</i>. The caulicle is held in a sheath
(formed mostly from the seed-coats), and some of
the roots escape through the upper end
of this sheath (<i>m</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig24_25_26">26</a>). The
epicotyl elongates, particularly if
the seed is planted
deep or if it is
kept for a time
confined. In Fig.
<a href="#fig27">27</a> the epicotyl has
elongated from <i>n</i> to <i>p</i>. The true plumule-leaf is at <i>o</i>, but
other leaves grow from its sheath. In Fig. <a href="#fig28">28</a> the roots
are seen emerging from the two ends of the caulicle-sheath,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>

cones with seeds in them after
autumn has passed (Fig. <a href="#fig29">29</a>).
The cedar is also a gymnosperm.</p>

<p>Remove a scale from a

Examine the seed, preferably with a magnifying glass. Is
there a hilum? The micropyle is at the bottom or little
end of the seed. Toss a seed upward into the air. Why
does it fall so slowly? Can you explain the peculiar whirling
motion by the shape of the wing? Repeat the experiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Suggestions.</span>—Few subjects connected
with the study of plant-life are so
useful in schoolroom demonstrations as
germination. The pupil should prepare
the soil, plant the seeds, water them, and
care for the plants. <b>10.</b> Plant seeds in
pots or shallow boxes. The box should
not be very wide or long, and not over
four inches deep. Holes may be bored
in the bottom so it will not hold water.
Plant a number of squash, bean, corn,
pine, or other seeds about an inch deep
in damp sand or pine sawdust in this
box. The depth of planting should be
two to four times the diameter of the
seeds. Keep the sand or sawdust moist
but not wet. If the class is large, use
several boxes, that the supply of specimens
may be ample. Cigar boxes and
chalk boxes are excellent for individual
pupils. It is well to begin the planting
of seeds at least ten days in advance of
the lesson, and to make four or five different
plantings at intervals. A day or two
before the study is taken up, put seeds
to soak in moss or cloth. The pupil
then has a series from swollen seeds to
complete germination, and all the steps can be made out. Dry
seeds should be had for comparison. If there is no special room
for laboratory, nor duplicate apparatus for every pupil, each experiment
may be assigned to a committee of two pupils to watch
in the schoolroom. <b>11.</b> Good seeds for study are those detailed
in the lesson, and buckwheat, pumpkin, cotton, morning glory,
radish, four o’clock, oats, wheat. It is best to use familiar seeds
of farm and garden. Make drawings and notes of all the events
in the germination. Note the effects of unusual conditions, as
planting too deep and too shallow and different sides up. For
hypogeal germination, use the garden pea, scarlet runner, or Dutch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
case-knife bean, acorn, horse-chestnut. Squash seeds are excellent
for germination studies, because the cotyledons become green and
leafy and germination is rapid. Onion is excellent, except that it
germinates too slowly. In order to study the root development of
germinating plantlets, it is well to provide a deeper box with a glass
side against which the seeds are planted. <b>12.</b> Observe the germination
of any common seed about the house premises. When elms, oaks,
pines, or maples are abundant, the germination of their seeds may
be studied in lawns and along fences. <b>13.</b> When studying germination
the pupil should note the differences in shape and size between
cotyledons and plumule leaves, and between plumule leaves and the
normal leaves (Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a>). Make drawings. </p></div>

<p class="noindent"><b>14</b>. Make the tests described
in the introductory experiments with bean, corn, the castor
bean, and other seed for starch and proteids. Test flour, oatmeal,
rice, sunflower, four o’clock,
various nuts, and any other
seeds obtainable. Record your
results by arranging the seeds
in three classes, 1. Much starch
(colour blackish or purple), 2.
Little starch (pale blue or
greenish), 3. No starch (brown
or yellow). <b>15.</b> <i>Rate of
growth of seedlings as affected
by differences in temperature.</i>
Pack soft wet paper to the depth of an inch in the bottom of
four glass bottles or tumblers. Put ten soaked peas or beans into
each. Cover each securely and set them in places having different
temperatures that vary little. (A furnace room, a room with a stove,
a room without stove but reached by sunshine, an unheated room
not reached by the sun). Take the temperatures occasionally with the
thermometer to find difference in temperature. The tumblers in
warm places should be covered very tightly to prevent the germination
from being retarded by drying out. Record the number of seeds
which sprout in each tumbler within 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days,
etc. <b>16.</b> <i>Is air necessary for the germination and growth of seedlings?</i>
Place damp blotting paper in the bottom of a bottle and
fill it three-fourths full of soaked seeds, and close it tightly with a
rubber stopper or oiled cork. Prepare a “check experiment” by
having another bottle with all conditions the same except that it
is covered loosely that air may have access to it, and set the bottles
side by side (why keep the bottles together?). Record results as in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
preceding experiment. <b>17.</b> <i>What is the nature of the gas given off
by germinating seeds?</i> Fill a tin box or large-necked bottle with
dry beans or peas, then add water; note how much they swell. Secure
two fruit jars. Fill one of them a third full of beans and keep them
moist. Allow the other to remain empty. In a day or two insert
a lighted splinter or taper into each. In the empty jar the taper
burns: it contains oxygen. In the seed jar the taper goes out: the
air has been replaced by carbon dioxide. The air in the bottle may
be tested for carbon dioxide by removing some of it with a rubber
bulb attached to a glass tube (or a fountain-pen filler) and bubbling
it through lime water. <b>18.</b> <i>Temperature.</i> Usually there is a perceptible
rise in temperature in a mass of germinating seeds. This rise
may be tested with a thermometer. <b>19.</b> <i>Interior of seeds.</i> Soak
seeds for twenty-four hours and remove the coat. Distinguish the
embryo from the endosperm. Test with iodine. <b>20.</b> <i>Of what utility
is the food in seeds?</i> Soak some grains of corn overnight and remove
the endosperm, being careful not to injure the fleshy cotyledon.
Plant the incomplete and also some complete grains in moist sawdust
and measure their growth at intervals. (Boiling the sawdust will
destroy moulds and bacteria which might interfere 
<ins class="corr" id="experiment" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: with experiment">with the experiment</ins>.)
Peas or beans may be sprouted on damp blotting paper; the cotyledons
of one may be removed, and this with a normal seed equally
advanced in germination may be placed on a perforated cork floating
in water in a jar so that the roots extend into the water. Their
growth may be observed for several weeks. <b>21.</b> <i>Effect of darkness on
seeds and seedlings.</i> A box may be placed mouth downward over
a smaller box in which seedlings are growing. The empty box should
rest on half-inch blocks to allow air to reach the seedlings. Note
any effects on the seedlings of this cutting off of the light. Another
box of seedlings not so covered may be used as a check. Lay
a plank on green grass and after a week note the change that takes
place beneath it. <b>22.</b> <i>Seedling of pine.</i> Plant pine seeds. Notice
how they emerge. Do the cotyledons stay in the ground? How many
cotyledons have they? When do the cotyledons get free from the
seed-coat? What is the last part of the cotyledon to become free?
Where is the growing point or plumule? How many leaves appear at
once? Does the new pine cone grow on old wood or on wood formed
the same spring with the cone? Can you always find partly grown
cones on pine trees in winter? Are pine cones when mature on two-year-old
wood? How long do cones stay on a tree after the seeds
have fallen out? What is the advantage of the seeds falling before

the drawings for the notebook at home. A daily record of measurements
of the change in size of the various parts of the seedling
should also be made.</p>

<p> <b>24.</b> <i>Seed-testing.</i>—It is important that one
know before planting whether seeds are good, or able to grow. A
simple seed-tester may be made of two plates, one inverted over the
other (Fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>). The lower plate is nearly filled with clean sand,
which is covered with cheese cloth or blotting
paper on which the seeds are placed.
Canton flannel is sometimes used in place
of sand and blotting paper. The seeds are
then covered with another blotter or piece
of cloth, and water is applied until the
sand and papers are saturated. Cover with
the second plate. Set the plates where they
will have about the temperature that the
given seeds would require out of doors, or
perhaps a slightly higher temperature.
Place 100 or more grains of clover, corn,
wheat, oats, rye, rice, buckwheat, or other seeds in the tester, and
keep record of the number that sprout. The result will give a percentage
measure of the ability of the seeds to grow. Note whether
all the seeds sprout with equal vigour and rapidity. Most seeds
will sprout in a week or less. Usually such a tester must have fresh
sand and paper after each test, for mould fungi are likely to breed
in it. If canton flannel is used, it may be boiled. If possible, the
seeds should not touch one another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note to Teacher.</span>—With the study of germination, the pupil
will need to begin dissecting.</p>

<p><b>For dissecting</b>, one needs a lens for the examination of the
smaller parts of plants and animals. It is best to have the lens
mounted on a frame, so that the pupil has both hands free for
pulling the part in pieces. An ordinary pocket lens may be mounted
on a wire in a block as in Fig. <a href="#p031_ill">A</a>. A cork is slipped on the
top of the wire to avoid injury to the face. The pupil should be
provided with two dissecting needles (Fig. <a href="#p031_ill">B</a>), made by securing
an ordinary needle in a pencil-like stick. Another convenient arrangement
is shown in Fig. <a href="#p031_ill">C</a>. A small tin dish is used for the
base. Into this a stiff wire standard is soldered. The dish is filled
with solder to make it heavy and firm. Into a cork slipped on the
standard, a cross wire is inserted, holding on the end a jeweller’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
glass. The lens can be moved up and down and sidewise. This
outfit can be made for about seventy-five cents. Fig. <a href="#p031_ill">D</a> shows
a convenient hand-rest or dissecting-stand to be used under this
lens. It may be 16 in. long, 4 in. high, and 4 or 5 in. broad.</p>

<p>Various kinds of dissecting microscopes are on the market, and
these are to be recommended when they can be afforded.</p>

</div>



<p><b>The Root System.</b>—The offices of the root are <i>to hold
the plant in place</i>, and <i>to gather food</i>. Not all the food
materials, however, are gathered by the roots.</p>

<p>The entire mass of roots of any plant is called its <b>root
system</b>. The root system may be annual, biennial or perennial,
herbaceous or woody, deep or shallow, large or small.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Roots.</b>—A strong leading central root, which
runs directly downwards, is a <b>tap-root</b>. The tap-root forms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
an axis from which the side roots may branch. The side
or spreading roots are usually smaller. Plants that have
such a root system are said to be <i>tap-rooted</i>. Examples
are red clover, alfalfa, beet, turnip,
radish, burdock, dandelion, hickory
(Figs. <a href="#fig32_33">32, 33</a>).</p>

<p>A <b>fibrous root system</b> is one that
is composed of many nearly equal
slender branches. The greater
number of plants have fibrous roots.
Examples are many common
grasses, wheat, oats, corn. The
buttercup in Fig. <a href="#fig34">34</a> has a fibrous
root system. Many trees have a
strong tap-root when very young,
but after a while it ceases to extend
strongly and the side roots
develop until finally the tap-root
character disappears.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.—A Buttercup
Plant</span>, with fibrous roots.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Shape and Extent of the Root System.</b>—The
depth to which roots
extend depends on the <i>kind of plant</i>, and the <i>nature of the
soil</i>. Of most plants the roots extend far <i>in all directions</i>
and lie comparatively <i>near the surface</i>. The roots usually
radiate from a common point just beneath the surface of
the ground.</p>

<p><i>The roots grow here and there in search of food</i>, often
extending much farther in all directions than the spread
of the top of the plant. Roots tend to spread farther in
poor soil than in rich soil, for the same size of plant.
<i>The root has no such definite form as the stem has.</i> Roots
are usually very crooked, because they are constantly
turned aside by obstacles. Examine roots in stony soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p><i>The extent of root surface is usually very large</i>, for the
feeding roots are fine and very numerous. An ordinary
plant of Indian corn may have a total length of root
(measured as if the roots were placed end to end) of several
hundred feet.</p>

<p>The fine feeding roots are <i>most abundant in the richest
part of the soil</i>. They are attracted by the food materials.
Roots often will completely surround a bone or other
morsel. When roots of trees are exposed, observe that
most of them are horizontal and lie near the top of the
ground. Some roots, as of willows, extend far <i>in search
of water</i>. They often run into wells and drains, and into
the margins of creeks and ponds. Grow plants in a long
narrow box, in one end of which the soil is kept very dry
and in the other moist: observe where the roots grow.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.—The Bracing Base of a
Field Pine.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Buttresses.</b>—With the increase in diameter, the upper
roots often protrude above the ground and become <i>bracing
buttresses</i>. These buttresses are usually largest in trees
which always have been
exposed to strong winds
(Fig. <a href="#fig35">35</a>). Because of
growth and thickening,
the roots elevate part of
their diameter, and the
washing away of the soil
makes them to appear as
if having risen out of
the ground.</p>


<p><b>Aërial Roots.</b>—Although roots usually grow underground,
<i>there are some that naturally grow above ground</i>. These
usually occur on climbing plants, the roots becoming <i>supports</i>
or fulfilling the office of tendrils. These aërial roots
<i>usually turn away from the light</i>, and therefore enter the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
crevices and dark places of the wall or tree over which the
plant climbs. The trumpet creeper (Fig. <a href="#fig36">36</a>), true or
English ivy, and poison ivy climb by
means of roots.</p>

<p>In some plants all the roots are
aërial; that is, <i>the plant grows above
ground</i>, and the roots gather food
from the air. Such plants usually
grow on trees. They are known as
<i>epiphytes</i> or <i>air-plants</i>. The most familiar
examples are some of the tropical
orchids which are grown in glass-houses
(Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>). Rootlike organs of dodder and other
parasites are discussed in a future chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>

<p>Some plants bear aërial roots, that may <i>propagate the
plant</i> or may <i>act as braces</i>. They are often called <b>prop-roots</b>.
The roots of Indian corn are familiar (Fig. <a href="#fig38">38</a>). Many
ficus trees, as the banyan of India, send out roots from
their branches; when these roots reach the ground they
take hold and become great trunks, thus spreading the
top of the parent tree over large
areas. The mangrove tree of the
tropics grows along seashores and
sends down roots from the overhanging
branches (and from the
fruits) into the shallow water, and
thereby gradually marches into the
sea. The tangled mass behind catches
the drift, and soil is formed.</p>

<p><b>Adventitious Roots.</b>—Sometimes
roots grow from the stem or other
unusual places as the result of some
accident to the plant, being located
without known method or law. They
are called <b>adventitious</b> (chance)
<b>roots</b>. Cuttings of the stems of
roses, figs, geraniums, and other
plants, when planted, send out adventitious
roots and form new
plants. The ordinary roots, or soil roots, are of course not
classed as adventitious roots. The adventitious roots arise
on occasion, and not as a normal or regular course in the
growth of the plant.</p>

<p><b>No two roots are alike</b>; that is, they vary among themselves
as stems and leaves do. <i>Each kind of plant has its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
own form or habit of root</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig39">39</a>). Carefully wash away
the soil from the roots of any two related plants, as oats
and wheat, and note the differences in size, depth, direction,
mode of branching, number
of fibrils, colour, and other
features. The character of the root system often governs
the treatment that the farmer should give the soil in which
the plant or crop grows.</p>

<br>
Carefully trace the differences.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Roots differ not only in their form and habit, but also in
colour of tissue, character of bark or rind, and other features.
It is excellent practice to <i>try to identify different
plants by means of their roots</i>. Let each pupil bring to
school two plants with the roots very carefully dug up, as
cotton, corn, potato, bean, wheat, rye, timothy, pumpkin,
clover, sweet pea, raspberry, strawberry, or other common
plants.</p>

<p><b>Root Systems of Weeds.</b>—Some weeds are pestiferous
because they seed abundantly, and others because their
underground parts run deep or far and are persistent.

<span class="chapt_sub">THE ROOT.—FUNCTION AND STRUCTURE</span></h2>
</div>



<p><b>The function of roots is twofold</b>,—to provide <i>support or
anchorage</i> for the plant, and to <i>collect and convey food</i> materials.
The first function is considered in Chapter VII;
we may now give attention in more detail to the second.</p>

under Different Soil
Treatments.</span> Soil deficient
in nitrogen; commercial
nitrogen applied
to pot 3 (on right).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The feeding surface of the roots
is <i>near their ends</i>. As the roots
become old and hard, they serve
only as <i>channels through which
food passes</i> and as <i>hold-fasts or
supports</i> for the plant. The root hold
of a plant is very strong.
Slowly pull upwards on some plant,
and note how firmly it is anchored
in the soil.</p>



<p><b>Roots have power to choose their
food</b>; that is, they do not absorb
all substances with which they
come in contact. They do not take
up great quantities of useless or
harmful materials, even though
these materials may be abundant in the soil; but they
may take up a greater quantity of some of the plant-foods
than the plant can use to advantage. <i>Plants respond very
quickly to liberal feeding</i>,—that is, to the application of
plant-food to the soil (Fig 40). The poorer the soil, the
more marked are the results, as a rule, of the application<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
of fertilizers. Certain substances, as common salt, will kill
the roots.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.—Nodules on Roots
of Red Clover.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Roots absorb Substances only in Solution.</b>—Substances
cannot be taken in solid particles. These materials are
in solution in the soil water, and the roots themselves
also have the power to dissolve the soil materials to some
extent by means of substances that
they excrete. The materials that
come into the plant through the
roots are <i>water and mostly the mineral
substances</i>, as compounds of potassium,
iron, phosphorus, calcium,
magnesium, sulphur, and chlorine.
These mineral substances compose
the ash when the plant is burned.
The carbon is derived from the air
through the green parts. Oxygen
is derived from the air and the soil
water.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/fig42.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.—Nodules on Vetch.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Nitrogen enters through the Roots.</b>—All
plants must have nitrogen;
yet, although about four-fifths of
the air is nitrogen, plants are not
able, so far as we know, to take it in through their leaves.
It enters through the roots in combination with other elements,
chiefly in the form of nitrates (certain combinations
with oxygen and a mineral base). The great family of
leguminous plants, however (as peas, beans, cowpea,
clover, alfalfa, vetch), <i>use the nitrogen contained in the air
in the soil</i>. They are able to utilize it through the <i>agency
of nodules</i> on their roots (Figs. <a href="#fig41">41</a>, <a href="#fig42">42</a>). These nodules
contain bacteria, which appropriate the free or uncombined
nitrogen and pass it on to the plant. The nitrogen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
becomes incorporated in the plant tissue, so that these
crops are high in their nitrogen content. Inasmuch as
nitrogen in any form is
expensive to purchase in
fertilizers, the use of leguminous
crops to plough under
is a very important agricultural
practice in preparing
the land for other
crops. In order that leguminous
crops may acquire atmospheric
nitrogen more
freely and thereby thrive
better, <i>the land is sometimes
sown or inoculated with the
nodule-forming bacteria</i>.</p>

been Wet and then Dried.</span> The
loamy soil above remains loose and capable
of growing plants; the clay soil below
has baked and cracked.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Roots require moisture</b> in order to serve the plant. The
soil water that is valuable
to the plant is not
the free water, but the
<i>thin film of moisture
which adheres to each
little particle of soil</i>. The
finer the soil, the greater
the number of particles,
and therefore the greater
is the quantity of film
moisture that it can hold.
This moisture surrounding
the grains may not
be perceptible, yet the
plant can use it. <i>Root absorption may continue in a soil
which seems to be dust dry.</i> Soils that are very hard and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
“baked” (Fig. <a href="#fig43">43</a>) contain very little moisture or air,—not
so much as similar soils that are granular or mellow.</p>

<p><b>Proper Temperature for Root Action.</b>—<i>The root must be
warm in order to perform its functions.</i> Should the soil of
fields or greenhouses be much colder than the air, the
plant suffers. When in a warm atmosphere, or in a dry
atmosphere, plants need to absorb much water from the
soil, and the roots must be warm if the root-hairs are to
supply the water as rapidly as it is needed. <i>If the roots are
chilled, the plant may wilt or die.</i></p>

<p><b>Roots need Air.</b>—Corn on land that has been flooded by
heavy rains loses its green colour and turns yellow. <i>Besides
diluting plant-food, the water drives the air from the soil, and
this suffocation of the roots is very soon apparent
in the general ill health of the plant.</i>
Stirring or tilling the soil aërates it. Water
plants and bog plants have adapted themselves
to their particular conditions. They
get their air either by special surface roots,
or from the water through stems and leaves.</p>

<p><b>Rootlets.</b>—<i>Roots divide into the thinnest
and finest fibrils: there are roots and there
are rootlets.</i> The smallest rootlets are so
slender and delicate that they break off
even when the plant is very carefully lifted
from the soil.</p>


<p><i>The rootlets, or fine divisions, are clothed with the</i> <b>root-hairs</b>
(Figs. <a href="#fig44">44</a>, <a href="#fig45">45</a>, <a href="#fig46">46</a>). <i>These root-hairs attach to the
soil particles, and a great amount of soil is thus brought
into actual contact with the plant.</i> These are very <i>delicate
prolonged surface cells of the roots</i>. They are borne
for a short distance just back of the tip of the root.</p>

</figure>

<p><i>Rootlet and root-hair differ.</i> The rootlet is a <i>compact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
cellular structure. The root-hair is a delicate tubular
cell</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>), <i>within which is contained living matter
(protoplasm); and the protoplasmic lining membrane of the
wall governs the entrance of
water and substances in solution.</i>
Being long and tube-like,
these root-hairs are
especially adapted for taking
in the largest quantity
of solutions; and they are
the principal means by which
plant-food is absorbed from
the soil, although the surfaces
of the rootlets themselves
do their part. Water
plants do not produce an
abundant system of root-hairs, and such plants depend
largely on their rootlets.</p>

particles (<i>s</i>). Air-spaces at <i>a</i>;

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The root-hairs are very small, often invisible. They,
with the young roots, are usually broken off when the
plant is pulled up. They are
best seen when seeds are germinated
between layers of dark
blotting paper or flannel. On
the young roots they will be
seen as a mould-like or gossamer-like
covering. <i>Root-hairs soon
die</i>: they do not grow into roots.
New ones form as the root grows.</p>



<p><b>Osmosis.</b>—The water with its
nourishment goes through the
thin walls of the root-hairs and rootlets by the process
of osmosis. If there are two liquids of different density<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
on the inside and outside of an organic (either vegetable
or animal) membrane, the liquids tend to mix through the
membrane. The <i>law of osmosis</i> is that <i>the most rapid
flow is toward the denser solution</i>. The protoplasmic lining
of the cell wall is such a membrane. The soil water
being a weaker solution than the sap in the roots, the
flow is into the root. A strong fertilizer sometimes causes
a plant to wither, or “burns it.” Explain.</p>

<p><b>Structure of Roots.</b>—The root that grows from the lower
end of the caulicle is the <i>first</i> or <b>primary root. Secondary
roots</b> branch from the primary root. Branches of secondary
roots are sometimes called <b>tertiary roots</b>. Do the secondary
roots grow from the cortex, or from the central
cylinder of the primary root? Trim or peel the cortex
from a root and its branches and determine whether the
branches still hold to the central cylinder of the main root.</p>

<p><b>Internal Structure of Roots.</b>—A section of a root shows
that it consists of a <i>central cylinder</i> (see Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>) surrounded
by a layer. This layer is called the <b>cortex</b>. The
outer layer of cells in the cortex is called the <b>epidermis</b>,
and some of the cells of the epidermis are prolonged
and form the delicate root-hairs. The cortex resembles
the bark of the stem in its nature. The central cylinder
contains many tube-like canals, or “vessels” that convey
water and food (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>). Cut a sweet potato across (also
a radish and a turnip) and distinguish the central cylinder,
cortex, and epidermis. Notice the hard cap on the tip
of roots. Roots differ from stems in having no real pith.</p>

the central cylinder from the bark;
the <b>cortex</b>, or inner bark, (<i>e</i>) of several
layers outside the endodermis;
and the <b>epidermis</b>, or outer layer of

a drawing of the section. If a
series of the cross-sections of the

by the pupil beginning near
the growing point and going upward,
it would be found that these four tissues become more
distinctly marked, for at the tip the tissues have not yet
assumed their characteristic form. The central cylinder
contains the ducts and vessels which convey the sap.</p>

a number of roots, including several fleshy roots, for the
presence of food material, making the tests used on seeds. <b>26.</b>
<i>Study of root-hairs.</i> Carefully germinate radish, turnip, cabbage,
or other seed, so that no delicate parts of the root will be injured.
For this purpose, place a few seeds in packing-moss or in the folds
of thick cloth or of blotting paper, being careful to keep them moist
and warm. In a few days the seed has germinated, and the root
has grown an inch or two long. Notice that, except at a distance
of about a quarter of an inch behind the tip, the root is
covered with minute hairs (Fig. <a href="#fig44">44</a>). They are actually hairs;
that is, root-hairs. Touch them and they collapse, they are so
delicate. Dip one of the plants in water, and when removed the
hairs are not to be seen. The water mats them together along
the root and they are no longer evident. Root-hairs are usually
destroyed when a plant is pulled out of the soil, be it done
ever so carefully. They cling to the minute particles of soil
(Fig. <a href="#fig46">46</a>). The hairs show best against a dark background.
<b>27.</b> On some of the blotting papers, sprinkle sand; observe how
the root-hairs cling to the grains. Observe how they are flattened
when they come in contact with grains of sand. </p>

then boring through it with the tube. Now set the egg upon the
mouth of a pickle jar nearly full of water, so that the large end
with the exposed membrane is beneath the water. After several
hours, observe the tube on top of the egg to see whether the water
has forced its way into the egg and increased its volume so that
part of its contents are forced up into the tube. If no tube is at
hand, see whether the contents are forced through the hole which
has been made in the small end of the egg. Explain how the law

an inch and a half long each, with waterproof ink mark spaces

<p><b>The Stem System.</b>—The stem of a plant is the part
that <i>bears the buds, leaves, flowers, and fruits</i>. Its office
is <i>to hold these parts up to the light and the air</i>; and
through its tissues the various food materials and the life-giving
fluids <i>are distributed to the growing and working
parts</i>.</p>

<p>The entire mass or fabric of stems of any plant is called
its <b>stem system</b>. It comprises the trunk, branches, and
twigs, but not the stalks of leaves and flowers that die and
fall away. The stem system may be herbaceous or woody,
annual, biennial, or perennial; and it may assume many
sizes and shapes.</p>

<p><b>Stems are of Many Forms.</b>—The general way in which
a plant grows is called its <b>habit</b>. The habit is the <i>appearance
or general form</i>. Its habit may be open or loose,
dense, straight, crooked, compact, straggling, climbing,
erect, weak, strong, and the like. The roots and the leaves
are <i>the important functional or working parts</i>; the stem
merely connects them, and its form is exceedingly variable.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Stems.</b>—<i>The stem may be so short as to be
scarcely distinguishable.</i> In such cases the crown of the
plant—that part just at the surface of the ground—bears
the leaves and the flowers; but this crown is really a very
short stem. The dandelion, Fig. <a href="#fig32_33">33</a>, is an example. Such
plants are often said to be <b>stemless</b>, however, in order to
distinguish them from plants that have long or conspicuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
stems. <i>These so-called stemless plants die to the
ground every year.</i></p>

when they run on the ground and take root at places,
as the strawberry. They are <b>decumbent</b> when they <ins class="corr"

over to the ground. They are <b>ascending</b> when they lie
mostly or in part on the ground but stand more or less
upright at their ends; example, a tomato. They are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
<b>climbing</b> when they cling to other objects

<p>Trees in which the main trunk or the
“leader” continues to grow from its tip
are said to be <b>excurrent</b> in growth. <i>The
branches are borne along the sides of the
trunk</i>, as in common pines (Fig. <a href="#fig57_58">57</a>) and
spruces. Excurrent means <i>running out</i> or
<i>running up</i>.</p>

<p>Trees in which the main trunk does
not continue are said to be <b>deliquescent</b>.
<i>The branches arise from one
common point or from each other.</i> The
stem is lost in the branches. The apple
tree, plum (Fig.<a href="#fig57_58"> 58</a>), maple, elm, oak, China
tree, are familiar examples. Deliquescent
means <i>dissolving</i> or <i>melting away</i>.</p>

<p><b>Each kind of plant has its own peculiar
habit or direction of growth.</b> Spruces always
grow to a single stem or trunk, pear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
trees are always deliquescent, morning-glories are always
trailing or climbing, strawberries are always creeping.
We do not know why each plant has its own habit, but
the habit is in some way <i>associated with the plant’s genealogy
or with the way in which it has been obliged to live</i>.</p>

<p>The stem may be <b>simple</b> or <b>branched</b>. A simple stem
usually grows from the terminal bud, and side branches
either do not start, or, if they start, they soon perish.
Mulleins (Fig. <a href="#fig53_54">53</a>) are usually simple. So are palms.</p>

<p><i>Branched stems may be of very different habit and shape.</i>
Some stem systems are narrow and erect; these are said
to be <i>strict</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig53_54">54</a>). Others are <i>diffuse</i>, <i>open</i>, <i>branchy</i>,
<i>twiggy</i>.</p>

<p><b>Nodes and Internodes.</b>—The parts of the stem at which
buds grow are called <b>nodes</b> or <b>joints</b> and the spaces between
the buds are <b>internodes</b>. The stem at nodes is
usually enlarged, and the pith is usually interrupted. The
distance between the nodes is influenced by the vigour of
the plant: how?</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/fig59.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.—Rhizome or Rootstock.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Stems vs. Roots.</b>—Roots sometimes grow above ground
(Chap. VII); so, also, <i>stems sometimes grow underground</i>,
and they are then known as <b>subterranean stems</b>, <b>rhizomes</b>,
or <b>rootstocks</b> (Fig. <a href="#fig59">59</a>).</p>

<p><b>Stems normally bear leaves and buds, and thereby are
they distinguished from roots</b>; usually, also, they contain
a pith. The leaves, however, may be reduced to mere
scales, and the buds beneath them may be scarcely visible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Thus the “eyes” on a white potato are cavities with a
bud or buds at the bottom (Fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>). Sweet potatoes have
no evident “eyes” when first dug (but they may develop
adventitious buds before the next growing season).
The white potato is a stem:
the sweet potato is probably a root.</p>

<p><b>How Stems elongate.</b>—<i>Roots elongate
by growing near the tip. Stems elongate
by growing more or less throughout
the young or soft part</i> or “between
joints” (Figs. <a href="#fig48">48</a>,<a href="#fig49"> 49</a>). But any part
of the stem soon reaches a limit beyond which it cannot
grow, or becomes “fixed”; and the new parts beyond
elongate until they, too, become rigid. When a part of
the stem once becomes fixed or hard, it never increases in
length: that is, <i>the trunk or woody parts never grow longer
or higher; branches do not become farther apart or higher
from the ground</i>.</p>

</figure>

<p><b>Stems are modified in form</b> by the particular or incidental
conditions under which they grow. <i>The struggle for light</i>
is the chief factor in determining the shape and the direction
of any limb (Chap. II). This is well illustrated in any
tree or bush that grows against a building or on the margin
of a forest (Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>). In a very dense thicket the
innermost trees shoot up over the others or they perish.
Examine any stem and endeavour to determine why it took
its particular form.</p>

<figcaption class="caption caphang">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 61.—Cracking of the Bark on an Elm Branch.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>The stem is cylindrical</b>, <i>the outer part being bark and
the inner part being wood or woody tissue</i>. In the dicotyledonous
plants, the bark is usually easily separated from
the remainder of the cylinder at some time of the year; in
monocotyledonous plants the bark is not free. Growth in
thickness takes place inside the covering and not on the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
outside of the plant cylinder. It is evident, then, that the
covering of <i>bark must expand in order to allow of the expansion
of the woody cylinder within it</i>. The tissues,
therefore, must be under constant pressure
or tension. It has been determined that the
pressure within a growing trunk is often as
much as fifty pounds to the square inch. The
lower part of the limb in Fig. <a href="#fig61">61</a> shows that
the outer layers of bark (which are long since
dead, and serve only as protective tissue) have
reached the limit of their expanding capacity
and have begun to split. The pupil will now
be interested in the bark on the body of an old
elm tree (Fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a>); and he should be able to
suggest one reason why stems remain cylindrical,
and why the old bark becomes marked
with furrows, scales, and plates.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="fig62">

<figcaption class="caption caphang"><span class="smcap">Fig.
62.—Piece of Bark from an Old Elm Trunk.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most woody plants increase in diameter by the
addition of an <i>annual layer</i> or “<i>ring</i>” on the
outside of the woody cylinder,
underneath the bark. The monocotyledonous
plants comprise very few trees and
shrubs in temperate climates (the palms,
yuccas, and other tree-like plants are of
this class), and they do not increase
greatly in diameter and they rarely branch
to any extent.</p>


<p><b>Bark-bound Trees.</b>—If, for any reason,
the bark should become so dense
and strong that the trunk cannot expand,
the tree is said to be “bark-bound.”
Such condition is not rare in orchard trees that have been
neglected. When good tillage is given to such trees, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
may not be able to overcome the rigidity of the old bark,
and, therefore, do not respond to the treatment. Sometimes
the parts with thinner bark may outgrow in diameter the
trunk or the old branches below them. The remedy is
to <i>release the tension</i>. This may be done either by softening
the bark (by washes of soap or lye), or by separating
it. The latter is done by slitting the bark-bound part
(in spring), thrusting the point of a knife through the
bark to the wood, and then drawing the blade down the
entire length of the bark-bound
part. The slit is scarcely discernible at first, but it opens with
the growth of the tree, filling up with new tissue beneath. Let the
pupil consider the ridges which he now and then finds on trees, and
determine whether they have any significance—whether the tree has
ever been released, or injured by natural agencies.</p>

over the wound. This ring of healing tissue forms most
rapidly and uniformly when the wound is smooth and regular.
Observe the healing on broken and splintered limbs;
also the difference in rapidity of healing between wounds
on strong and weak limbs. There is a difference in the
rapidity of the healing process in different kinds of trees.
Compare the apple tree and the peach. This tissue may in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
turn become bark-bound, and the healing may stop. On
large wounds it progresses more rapidly the first few years
than it does later. This roll or

<p><b>The callus grows from the living

the wound. It cannot cover long
dead stubs or very rough broken
branches (Fig. <a href="#fig64">64</a>). Therefore,
in pruning <i>the branches should be

even and smooth; <i>all long stubs

the wound should be close to the
living part of the trunk, for the
stub of the limb that is severed
has no further power in itself
of making healing tissue. The
end of the remaining stub is
merely covered over by the
callus, and usually remains a
dead piece of wood sealed inside
the trunk (Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>). If
wounds do not heal over speedily,
germs and fungi obtain
foothold in the dying wood
and <i>rot sets in</i>. Hollow trees
are those in which the decay-fungi
have progressed into the

<span class="chapt_sub">THE STEM—ITS GENERAL STRUCTURE</span></h2>
</div>



<p>There are two main types of stem structure in flowering
plants, the differences being based on the arrangement of
bundles or strands of tissue. These types are <i>endogenous</i>
and <i>exogenous</i> (page 20). It will require patient laboratory
work to understand what these types and structures are.</p>

<p><b>Endogenous, or Monocotyledonous Stems.</b>—Examples of
endogenous stems are all the grasses, cane-brake, sugar-cane,
smilax or green-brier, palms, banana, canna, bamboo, lilies, yucca,
asparagus, all the cereal grains. For our study, a cornstalk may be
used as a type.</p>

bundles. Slightly enlarged.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A piece of <i>cornstalk</i>, either green or dead, should be in
the hand of each pupil while studying this lesson. Fig. <a href="#fig69">69</a> will
also be of use. Is there a swelling at the nodes? Which part of
the internode comes nearest to being perfectly round? There is a
grooved channel running along one side of the internode: how is it
placed with reference to the leaf? with reference to the groove in
the internode below it? What do you find in each groove at its lower
end? (In a dried stalk only traces of this are usually seen.) Does
any bud on a cornstalk besides the one at<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_60">[60]</span> the top ever develop? Where do suckers come
from? Where does the ear grow?</p>

 <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.
70.—Diagram to show the Course of Fibro-vascular Bundles in
Monocotyledons.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Cut a cross-section of the stalk between the nodes (Fig. <a href="#fig69">69</a>).
Does it have a distinct bark? The interior consists of soft “pith”
and tough woody parts. The wood is found in <i>strands</i> or
<i>fibres</i>. Which is more abundant? Do the fibres have any
definite arrangement? Which strands are largest? Smallest? The
firm smooth <i>rind</i> (which cannot properly be called a bark)
consists of small wood strands packed closely together. Grass stems
are hollow cylinders; and the cornstalk, because of the lightness
of its contents, is also practically a cylinder. Stems of this kind
are admirably adapted for providing a strong support to leaves and
fruit. This is in accordance with the well-known law that a hollow
cylinder is much stronger than a solid cylinder of the same weight of
material. Cut a thin slice of the inner soft part and hold it up to
the light. Can you make out a number of tiny compartments or cells?
These cells consist of a tissue called <i>parenchyma</i>, the tissue
from which when young all the other tissues arise and differentiate.
The numerous walls of these cells may serve to brace the outer wall
of the cylinder; but their chief function in the young stalk is to
give origin to other cells. When alive they are filled with cell sap
and protoplasm.</p>



<p>Trace the <i>woody strands</i> through the nodes.
Do they ascend vertically? Do they curve
toward the rind at certain places? Compare
their course with the strands shown in Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a>. <i>The woody
strands consist chiefly of tough fibrous cells that give rigidity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
and strength to the plant, and of long tubular interrupted
canals that serve to convey sap upward from the root and to
convey food downward from the leaves to the stem and the
roots.</i></p>

<p>Monocotyledons, as shown by fossils, existed before
dicotyledons appeared, and it is thought that the latter
were developed from ancestors of the
former. It will be interesting to trace
the relationship in stem structure. It
will first be necessary to learn something
of the structure of the wood strand.</p>

<p><b>Wood Strand in Monocotyledons and
Dicotyledons.</b>—Each wood strand (or
fibro-vascular bundle) consists of two
parts—the bast and the wood proper.
The wood is on the side of the strand
toward the centre of the stem and contains
large tubular canals that take the watery sap upward
from the roots. The bast is on the side toward the bark,
and contains fine tubes
through which diffuses
the dense sap containing
digested food from
the leaves. In the root
(Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a>) the bast and
the wood are separate,
so that there are <i>two
kinds of strands</i>.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption caphang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.—Part of Cross-section of Rootstock
of Asparagus</span>, showing a few fibro-vascular

</figure>

<p>In monocotyledons, as already said, the strands (or bundles)
<i>are usually scattered in the stem with no definite arrangement</i>
(Figs. <a href="#fig72">72</a>, <a href="#fig73">73</a>). In dicotyledons the strands, or bundles, <i>are
arranged in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
ring.</i> As the dicotyledonous seed germinates, five bundles are
usually formed in its hypocotyl (Fig. <a href="#fig74">74</a>); soon five more are
interposed between them, and the multiplication continues, in tough
plants, until the bundles touch (Fig. <a href="#fig74">74</a>, right). The inner parts
thus form a ring of wood and the outer parts form the inner bark or
bast. A new ring of wood or bast is formed on stems of dicotyledons
each year, and the age of a cut stem is easily determined.</p>

<p>When cross-sections of
monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous
bundles are
examined under the microscope,
it is readily seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
why dicotyledonous bundles form rings of wood and monocotyledonous
cannot (Figs. <a href="#fig75">75</a> and <a href="#fig76">76</a>). The dicotyledonous
bundle (Fig. <a href="#fig76">76</a>) has, running across it, a layer of brick-shaped
cells called <b>cambium</b>, which cells are a specialized
form of the parenchyma cells and retain the power of
growing and multiplying. The bundles containing cambium
are called <i>open bundles</i>. There is no cambium in
monocotyledonous bundles (Fig. <a href="#fig75">75</a>) and the bundles are
called <i>closed bundles</i>. Monocotyledonous stems <i>soon cease
to grow in diameter</i>. The stem of a palm tree is almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
as large at the top as at the base. As dicotyledonous
plants grow, the <i>stems become thicker each year</i>, for the
delicate active cambium layer forms new cells from early
spring until midsummer or autumn, adding to the wood
within and to the bark without. As the growth in spring
is very rapid, the first wood-cells formed are much larger
than the last wood-cells formed by the slow growth of the
late season, and the spring wood is less dense and of a
lighter colour than the summer wood; hence the time
between two years’ growth is readily made out (Figs. <a href="#fig77">77</a>
and <a href="#fig78">78</a>). Because of the rapid growth of the cambium in
spring and its consequent soft walls and fluid contents, the
bark of trees “peels” readily at that season.</p>

<p><b>The Several Plant Cells and their Functions.</b>—In the

rigid (h, Fig. <a href="#fig76">76</a>), and serve to <i>support</i> the <b>sap-canals</b>
or <i>wood vessels</i> (or tracheids) that are formed by the
absorption of the end walls of upright rows of cells; the canals
pass from the roots to the twigs and even to ribs of the leaves and
serve to transport the root water. They are recognized (Fig. <a href="#fig79">79</a>)
by the peculiar thickening of the wall on the inner surface of the
tubes, occurring in the form of spirals. Sometimes the whole wall
is thickened except in spots called <i>pits</i> (g, Fig. <a href="#fig76">76</a>). These
thin spots (Fig. <a href="#fig80">80</a>) allow the sap to pass to other cells or to
neighbouring vessels.</p>

<p><b>The bark</b> consists of inner or <i>fibrous bark</i> or new
bast (these fibres in flax become linen), the <i>green or middle
bark</i> which functions somewhat as the leaves, and the <i>corky
or outer bark</i>. The common word “bark” is seen, therefore,
not to represent a homogeneous or simple structure, but rather a
collection of several kinds of tissue, all separating from the
wood beneath by means of cambium. The new bast contains (1) the
<i>sieve-tubes</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig81">81</a>) which transport the sap containing
organic substances, as sugar and proteids, from the leaves to the
parts needing it (<i>s</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig76">76</a>). These tubes have been formed
like the wood vessels, but they have sieve-plates to allow the dense
organic-laden sap to pass with sufficient readiness for purposes
of rapid distribution. (2) There are also thick-walled <i>bast
fibres</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig82">82</a>) in the bast that serve for <i>support</i>.
(3) There is also some parenchyma in the new bast; it is now in

thickened, forming <i>grit cells</i> or <i>stone cells</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig84">84</a>;
examples in tough parts of pear, or in stone of fruits). Some parts
serve for secretions (milk, rosin, etc.) and are called <i>latex
tubes</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>outer bark</b> of old shoots consists of <i>corky</i> cells that
<i>protect</i> from mechanical injury, and that contain a fatty substance
(suberin) impermeable to water and of service to
<i>keep in moisture</i>. There is sometimes a cork cambium (or
phellogen) in the bark that serves to extend the bark and
keep it from splitting, thus increasing its power to protect.</p>

<p><b>Transport of the “Sap.”</b>—We shall soon learn that the
common word “sap” does not represent a single or simple
substance. We may roughly distinguish two kinds of more
or less fluid contents: (1) <i>the root water</i>, sometimes called
mineral sap, that is taken in by the root, containing its
freight of such inorganic substances as potassium, calcium,
iron, and the rest; this root water rises, we have found, <i>in
the wood vessels</i>,—that is, in the young or “sapwood” (p.
<a href="#Page_96">96</a>); (2) the <i>elaborated</i> or <i>organized materials</i> passing back
and forth, especially from the leaves, to build up tissues
in all parts of the plant, some of it going down to the roots
and root-hairs; this organic material is transported, as we
have learned, <i>in the sieve-tubes of the inner bast</i>,—that is,
in the “inner bark.” Removing the bark from a trunk in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
a girdle will not stop the upward rise of the root water so
long as the wood remains alive; but it will stop the passage
of the elaborated or food-stored materials to parts below
and thus starve those parts; and if the girdle does not
heal over by the deposit of new bark, the tree will in time
<i>starve to death</i>. It will now be seen that the common
practice of placing wires or hoops about trees to hold
them in position or to prevent branches from falling is
irrational, because such wires interpose barriers over which
the fluids cannot pass; in
time, as the trunk increases
in diameter, the wire girdles
the tree. It is much better
to bolt the parts together by
rods extending through the
branches (Fig. <a href="#fig85">85</a>). These
bolts should fit very tight in
their holes. Why?</p>

<p><b>Wood.</b>—The main stem
or trunk, and sometimes
the larger branches, are the
sources of lumber and timber.
Different kinds of wood have value for their special
qualities. The business of raising wood, for all purposes,
is known as <i>forestry</i>. The forest is to be considered as a
crop, and the crop must be harvested, as much as corn or
rice is harvested. Man is often able to grow a more productive
forest than nature does.</p>

<p><b>Resistance to decay</b> gives value to wood used for shingles
(<i>cypress</i>, heart of <i>yellow pine</i>) and for fence posts (<i>mulberry</i>,
<i>cedar</i>, <i>post oak</i>, <i>bois d’arc</i>, <i>mesquite</i>).</p>

<p><b>Hardness and strength</b> are qualities of great value in
building. <i>Live oak</i> is used in ships. <i>Red oak</i>, <i>rock maple</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and <i>yellow pine</i> are used for floors. The best flooring is
sawn with the straight edges of the annual rings upward;
tangential sawn flooring may splinter. <i>Chestnut</i> is common
in some parts of the country, being used for ceiling and
inexpensive finishing and furniture. <i>Locust</i> and <i>bois d’arc</i>
(osage orange) are used for hubs of wheels; bois d’arc
makes a remarkably durable pavement for streets. <i>Ebony</i>
is a tropical wood used for flutes, black piano keys, and
fancy articles. <i>Ash</i> is straight and elastic; it is used
for handles for light implements. <i>Hickory</i> is very strong
as well as elastic, and is superior to ash for handles, spokes,
and other uses where strength is wanted. Hickory is
never sawn into lumber, but is split or turned. The
“second growth,” which sprouts from stumps, is most
useful, as it splits readily. Fast-growing hickory in rich
land is most valuable. The supply of useful hickory is
being rapidly exhausted.</p>

<p><b>Softness</b> <i>is often important</i>. <i>White pine</i> and <i>sweet gum</i>
because of their softness and lightness are useful in box-making.
“<i>Georgia</i>” or <i>southern pine</i> is harder and stronger
than white pine; it is much used for floors, ceilings, and
some kinds of cabinet work. <i>White pine</i> is used for window-sash,
doors, and moulding, and cheaper grades are used for
flooring. <i>Hemlock</i> is the prevailing lumber in the east for
the framework and clapboarding of buildings. <i>Redwood</i>
and <i>Douglas spruce</i> are common building materials on the
Pacific coast. <i>Cypress</i> is soft and resists decay and is
superior to white pine for sash, doors, and posts on the
outside of houses. <i>Cedar</i> is readily carved and has a
unique use in the making of chests for clothes, as its odour
repels moths and other insects. <i>Willow</i> is useful for baskets
and light furniture. <i>Basswood</i> or <i>linden</i> is used for
light ceiling and sometimes for cheap floors. <i>Whitewood</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
(incorrectly called poplar) is employed for wagon bodies
and often for house finishing. It often resembles curly
maple.</p>

<p><b>Beauty of grain and polish</b> gives wood value for furniture,
pianos, and the like. <i>Mahogany</i> and <i>white oak</i> are most
beautiful, although red oak is also used. Oak logs which are first
quartered and then sawn radially expose the beautiful silver grain
(medullary rays). Fig. <a href="#fig86">86</a> shows one <i>mode of quartering</i>. The
log is quartered on the lines <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>;
then succeeding boards are cut from each quarter at 1, 2, 3, etc.
The nearer the heart the better the “grain”: why? Ordinary boards
are sawn tangentially, as <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>. <i>Curly pine</i>,
<i>curly walnut</i>, and <i>bird’s-eye maple</i> are woods that owe
their beauty of grain to wavy lines or buried knots. A mere stump of
curly walnut is worth several hundred dollars. Such wood is sliced
very thin for veneering and glued over other woods in making pianos
and furniture. If the cause of wavy grain could be found out and such
wood grown at will, the discovery would be very useful. <i>Maple</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Note to Teacher.</span>—The work in this chapter is intended to be
mainly descriptive, for the purpose of giving the pupil a rational
conception of the main vital processes associated with the stem,
in such a way that he may translate it into his daily thought. It
is not intended to give advice for the use of the compound microscope.
If the pupil is led to make a careful study of the text, drawings,
and photographs on the preceding and the following pages,
he will obtain some of the benefit of studying microscope sections
without being forced to spend time in mastering microscope
technique. If the school is equipped with compound microscopes,
a teacher is probably chosen who has the necessary skill to
manipulate them and the knowledge of anatomy and physiology
that goes naturally with such work; and it would be useless to
give instruction in such work in a text of this kind. The writer is
of the opinion that the introduction of the compound microscope
into first courses in botany has been productive of harm. Good
and vital teaching demands first that the pupil have a normal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
direct, and natural relation to his subject, as he commonly meets
it, that the obvious and significant features of the plant world be
explained to him and be made a means of training him. The
beginning pupil cannot be expected to know the fundamental
physiological processes, nor is it necessary that these processes
should be known in order to have a point of view and trained
intelligence on the things that one customarily sees. Many a
pupil has had a so-called laboratory course in botany without
having arrived at any real conception of what plants mean, or
without having had his mind opened to any real sympathetic
touch with his environment. Even if one’s knowledge be not
deep or extensive, it may still be accurate as far as it goes, and
his outlook on the subject may be rational.</p>

<p><b>Kinds.</b>—Leaves
are <b>simple</b> or unbranched
(Figs. <a href="#fig88">88</a>,
<a href="#fig89">89</a>), and <b>compound</b> or
branched (Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
The method of compounding or branching follows the
mode of veining. The veining, or <b>venation</b>, is of two general
kinds. In some plants the main veins
diverge, and there is a conspicuous network
of smaller veins; such leaves are
<b>netted-veined</b>. They are characteristic of
the dicotyledons. In other plants the
main veins are parallel, or nearly so, and
there is no conspicuous network; these
are <b>parallel-veined</b> leaves (Figs. <a href="#fig89">89</a>, <a href="#fig102">102</a>).
These leaves are the rule in monocotyledonous
plants. The venation of netted-veined
leaves is <b>pinnate</b> or feather-like
when the veins arise from the side of a
continuous midrib (Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a>); <b>palmate</b> or
<b>digitate</b> (hand-like) when the veins arise
from the apex of the petiole (Figs. <a href="#fig88">88</a>, <a href="#fig92_93">92</a>). If leaves were
divided between the main veins, the former would be
pinnately and the latter digitately compound.</p>

<p>It is customary to speak of a leaf as compound only
when the parts or branches are completely separate blades,
as when the division extends to the midrib (Figs. <a href="#fig90">90</a>, <a href="#fig92_93">93</a>,
<a href="#fig94_95">94, 95</a>). The parts or branches are known as <b>leaflets</b>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Sometimes the leaflets themselves are compound, and the
whole leaf is then said to be <b>bi-compound</b> or <b>twice-compound</b>
(Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a>). Some leaves are three-compound, four-compound,
or five-compound. <b>Decompound</b> is a general
term to express any degree of
compounding beyond twice-compound.</p>

<p>The parts are called <b>lobes</b>, <b>divisions</b>, or

cleft leaf is sometimes said to be <b>pinnatifid</b>.</p>

<p>Leaves may have one or all of three parts—<b>blade</b>, or
expanded part; <b>petiole</b>, or stalk; <b>stipules</b>, or
appendages at the base of the petiole. A leaf that has all three
of these parts is said to be <b>complete</b> (Figs. <a href="#fig91">91</a>, <a href="#fig106">106</a>). The
stipules are often green and leaf-like and perform the function of
foliage as in the pea and the Japanese quince (the latter common in
yards).</p>

The same is said of flowers and fruits.
The blade of a sessile leaf may partly or
wholly surround the stem, when it is said
to be <b>clasping</b>. Examples: aster (Fig. <a href="#fig99">99</a>),
corn. In some cases the leaf runs down
the stem, forming a wing; such leaves are
said to be <b>decurrent</b> (Fig. <a href="#fig100">100</a>). When
opposite sessile leaves are joined by their
bases, they are said to be <b>connate</b> (Fig.<a href="#fig101"> 101</a>).</p>

<p>Leaflets may have one or all of these
three parts, but the stalks of
leaflets are called <b>petiolules</b>
and the stipules of leaflets are
called <b>stipels</b>. The leaf of the
garden bean has leaflets, petiolules,

<p>The blade is usually attached
to the petiole by <i>its lower edge</i>.
In pinnate-veined leaves, the petiole seems to
continue through the leaf as a <b>midrib</b> (Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a>).
In some plants, however, the petiole joins
the blade inside or beyond the margin (Fig. <a href="#fig92_93">92</a>). Such
leaves are said to be <b>peltate</b>
or shield-shaped. This
mode of attachment is particularly
common in floating
leaves (<i>e.g.</i> the water
lilies). Peltate leaves are
usually digitate-veined.</p>

<p><b>How to Tell a Leaf.</b>—It
is often difficult to distinguish
compound leaves from
leafy branches, and leaflets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
from leaves. As a rule leaves can be distinguished by
the following tests: (1) Leaves are <i>temporary structures</i>,
sooner or later falling. (2) Usually <i>buds are borne in their
axils</i>. (3) Leaves are usually <i>borne at joints or
nodes</i>. (4) They arise on wood of the <i>current
year’s growth</i>. (5) They have a more or less
<i>definite arrangement</i>. When leaves fall, the twig
that bore them remains; when leaflets fall, the
main petiole or stalk that bore them also falls.</p>

<p><b>Shapes.</b>—Leaves and leaflets are infinitely variable in
shape. Names have been given to some of the more definite or regular
shapes. These names are a part of the language of botany. The names
represent ideal or typical shapes; there are no two leaves alike and
very few that perfectly conform to the definitions. The shapes are
likened to those of familiar objects or of geometrical figures. Some
of the commoner shapes are as follows (name original examples in each
class):</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 109.—Different Forms of Leaves
from one Plant of Ampelopsis.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Leaves on the same plant often differ greatly in form. Observe the
different shapes of leaves on the young growths of mulberries (Fig.
<a href="#fig2">2</a>) and wild grapes; also on vigorous squash and
pumpkin vines. In some cases there may be simple and compound leaves
on the same plant. This is marked in the so-called Boston ivy or
ampelopsis (Fig. <a href="#fig109">109</a>), a vine that is used to
cover brick and stone buildings. Different degrees of compounding,
even in the same leaf, may often be found in honey locust. Remarkable
differences in forms are seen by comparing seed-leaves with mature
leaves of any plant (Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Leaf and its Environment.</b>—The form and shape
of the leaf often have direct relation to the <i>place in which
the leaf grows</i>. <i>Floating leaves are usually expanded and
flat</i>, and the petiole varies in length with the depth of
the water. <i>Submerged leaves are usually linear or thread-like</i>,
or are cut into very narrow divisions: thereby
more surface is exposed, and possibly the leaves are less
injured by moving water. Compare the sizes of the leaves
on the ends of branches with those at the base of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
branches or in the interior of the tree top. In dense
foliage masses, the petioles of the lowermost or undermost
leaves <i>tend to elongate</i>—to push the leaf to the light.</p>

<p>On the approach of winter the leaf usually ceases to
work, and dies. It may drop, when it is said to be <b>deciduous</b>;
or it may remain on the plant, when it is said to be
<b>persistent</b>. If persistent leaves remain green during the
winter, the plant is said to be <b>evergreen</b>. Give examples
in each class. Most leaves fall by breaking off at the
lower end of the petiole with a <i>distinct joint or articulation</i>.
There are many leaves, however, that wither and
hang on the plant until torn off by the wind; of such
are the leaves of grasses, sedges, lilies, orchids, and other
plants of the monocotyledons. Most leaves of this character
are parallel-veined.</p>

<p><i>Leaves also die and fall from lack of light.</i> Observe the
yellow and weak leaves in a dense tree top or in any
thicket. Why do the lower leaves die on house plants?
Note the carpet of needles under the pines. All evergreens
shed their leaves after a time. Counting back from
the tip of a pine or spruce shoot, determine how many
years the leaves persist. In some spruces a few leaves
may be found on branches ten or more years old.</p>

<p><b>Arrangement of Leaves.</b>—Most leaves have a regular
<i>position or arrangement</i> on the stem. <i>This position or
direction is determined largely by exposure to sunlight.</i> In
temperate climates they usually hang in such a way that
they receive the greatest amount of light. One leaf shades
another to the least possible degree. If the plant were
placed in a new position with reference to light, the leaves
would make an effort to turn their blades.</p>

<p><i>When leaves are</i> <b>opposite</b> <i>the pairs usually
alternate.</i> That is, if one pair stands north and south, the
next pair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> stands
east and west. See the box elder shoot, on the left in Fig. <a
href="#fig110">110</a>. <i>One pair does not shade the pair
beneath.</i> The leaves are in four vertical ranks.</p>

vertically above the first. This is true no matter which bud is taken
as the starting point. Draw a thread around the stem until the two
buds are joined. Set a pin at each bud. Observe that two buds are
passed (not counting the last) and that the thread makes one circuit
of the stem. Representing the number of buds by a denominator, and
the number of circuits by a numerator, we have the fraction ½,
<i>which expresses the part of the circle that lies between any two
buds</i>. That is, the buds are one half of 360 degrees apart, or
180 degrees. Looking endwise at the stem, the leaves are seen to be
2-ranked. Note that in the apple shoot (Fig. <a href="#fig110">110</a>, right) the thread
makes two circuits and five buds are passed: <i>two fifths represents
the divergence between the buds</i>. The leaves are 5-ranked.</p>

<p>Besides the <b>framework</b>, or system of veins found in
blades of all leaves, there is a soft cellular tissue called
<b>mesophyll</b>, or <b>leaf parenchyma</b>, and an <b>epidermis</b> or skin
that covers the entire outside part.</p>

contain the chlorophyll are at <i>b</i>. Epidermal cells at <i>c</i>.</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Mesophyll</b>.—The mesophyll is <i>not all alike or
homogeneous</i>. The upper layer is composed of elongated cells
placed perpendicular to the surface of the leaf. These are called
<b>palisade cells</b>. These cells are usually filled with green
bodies called <b>chlorophyll grains</b>. The grain contains a great
number of chlorophyll drops imbedded in the protoplasm. Below the
palisade cells is the spongy <b>parenchyma</b>, composed of cells
more or less <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: sphercal" id="sphercal"> spherical </ins> in shape, irregularly arranged, and provided
with many intercellular air cavities (Fig. <a href="#fig113">113</a>). In leaves of some
plants exposed to strong light there may be more than one layer
of palisade cells, as in the India-rubber plant and the oleander.
Ivy when grown in bright light will develop two such layers of
cells, but in shaded places it may be<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_87">[87]</span> found with only one. Such plants as iris and
compass plant, which have both surfaces of the leaf equally exposed
to sunlight, usually have a palisade layer beneath each epidermis.</p>

<p><b>Epidermis.</b>—The outer or epidermal cells of leaves do
not bear chlorophyll, but are usually so transparent that
the green mesophyll can be seen through them. They
often become very thick-walled, and are in most plants
devoid of all protoplasm except a thin layer lining the
walls, the cavities being filled with cell sap. This sap is
sometimes coloured, as in the under epidermis of begonia
leaves. It is not common to find more than one layer of
epidermal cells forming each surface of a leaf. The epidermis
<i>serves to retain moisture</i> in the leaf and as a general
<i>protective covering</i>. In desert plants the epidermis, as a
rule, is very thick and has a dense cuticle, thereby preventing
loss of water.</p>

<p>There are various <i>outgrowths of the epidermis</i>. <b>Hairs</b>
are the chief of these. They may be (1) <b>simple</b>, as on
primula, geranium, nægelia; (2) <b>once branched</b>, as on wall-flower;
(3) <b>compound</b>, as on verbascum or mullein; (4)
<b>disk-like</b>, as on shepherdia; (5) <b>stellate</b>, or star-shaped, as
in certain crucifers. In some cases the hairs are <b>glandular</b>,
as in Chinese primrose of the greenhouses (<i>Primula
Sinensis</i>) and certain hairs of pumpkin flowers. The hairs
often protect the breathing-pores, or stomates, from dust
and water.</p>

<p><b>Stomates</b> (sometimes called <b>breathing-pores</b>) <i>are small
openings or pores</i> in the epidermis of leaves and soft stems
that allow the passage of air and other gases and vapours
(<i>stomate</i> or <i>stoma</i>, singular; <i>stomates</i> or <i>stomata</i>, plural).
They are <i>placed near the large intercellular spaces</i> of the
mesophyll, usually in positions least affected by direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
sunlight. Fig. <a href="#fig114">114</a> shows the structure. There are <b>two
guard-cells</b> at the mouth of each stomate, which may in
most cases open or close the passage as the conditions
of the atmosphere may require. The guard-cells contain
chlorophyll. In Fig. <a href="#fig115">115</a> is shown a case in which there
are compound guard-cells, that of ivy. On the margins
of certain leaves, as of fuchsia, impatiens, cabbage, are
openings known as <b>water-pores</b>.</p>

<p>The function or work of the stomates
is to <i>regulate the passage of gases</i> into
and out of the plant. The directly
active organs or parts are guard-cells,
on either side the opening. One
method of opening is as follows: The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
thicker walls of the guard-cells (Fig. <a href="#fig114">114</a>) absorb water
from adjacent cells, these thick walls buckle or bend and
part from one another at their middles on either side the
opening, causing the stomate to open, when the air gases
may be taken in and the leaf gases may pass out. When
moisture is reduced in the leaf tissue, the guard-cells part
with some of their contents, the thick walls
straighten, and the faces of the two opposite
ones come together, thus closing the stomate
and preventing any water vapour from passing
out. <i>When a leaf is actively at work
making new organic compounds, the stomates
are usually open; when unfavourable conditions
arise, they are usually closed.</i> They
also commonly close at night, when growth
(or the utilizing of the new materials) is most
likely to be active. It is sometimes safer to
fumigate greenhouses and window gardens
at night, for the noxious vapours are less
likely to enter the leaf. Dust may clog or
cover the stomates. Rains benefit plants
by washing the leaves as well as by providing
moisture to the roots.</p>

<p><b>Lenticels</b>.—On the young woody twigs
of many plants (marked in osiers, cherry,
birch) there are small corky spots or elevations
known as <b>lenticels</b> (Fig. <a href="#fig117">117</a>). They mark the location
of some loose cork cells that function as stomates,
for <i>green shoots</i>, as well as leaves, take in and discharge
gases; that is, soft green twigs <i>function as leaves</i>. Under
some of these twig stomates, corky material may form
and the opening is torn and enlarged: <i>the lenticels are
successors to the stomates</i>. The stomates lie in the epidermis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
but as the twig ages the epidermis perishes and
the bark becomes the external layer. <i>Gases continue to
pass in and out through the lenticels</i>, until the branch becomes
heavily covered with thick, corky bark. With the
growth of the twig, the lenticel scars enlarge lengthwise
or crosswise or assume other shapes, often becoming characteristic
markings.</p>

<p><b>Fibro-vascular Bundles.</b>—We have studied the fibro-vascular
bundles of stems (Chap. X). These stem bundles
<i>continue into the leaves, ramifying into the veins</i>,
carrying the soil water inwards and bringing, by diffusion,
the elaborated food out through the sieve-cells. Cut
across a petiole and notice the hard spots or areas in it;
strip these parts lengthwise of the petiole. What are they?</p>

<p><b>Fall of the Leaf.</b>—In most common deciduous plants,
when the season’s work for the leaf is ended, the nutritious
matter may be withdrawn, and <i>a layer of corky cells is completed
over the surface of the stem where the leaf is attached</i>.
<i>The leaf soon falls.</i> It often falls even before it is killed
by frost. Deciduous leaves begin to show the surface line
of articulation in the early growing season. This articulation
may be observed at any time during the summer. The
area of the twig once covered by the petioles is called the
<b>leaf-scar</b> after the leaf has fallen. In Chap. XV are shown
a number of leaf-scars. In the plane tree (sycamore or
buttonwood), the leaf-scar is in the form of a ring surrounding
the bud, for the bud is covered by the hollowed end of
the petiole; the leaf of sumac is similar. Examine with a
hand lens leaf-scars of several woody plants. Note the
number of bundle-scars in each leaf-scar. Sections may
be cut through a leaf-scar and examined with the microscope.
Note the character of cells that cover the leaf-scar
surface.</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">LEAVES—FUNCTION OR WORK</span></h2>
</div>



<p>We have discussed (in Chap. VIII) the work or function
of roots and also (in Chap. X) the function of stems.
We are now ready to complete the view of the main vital
activities of plants by considering the function of the
green parts (leaves and young shoots).</p>

<p><b>Sources of Food.</b>—The ordinary green plant has but <i>two
sources from which to secure food,—the air and the soil</i>.
When a plant is thoroughly dried in an oven, the water
passes off; <i>this water came from the soil</i>. The remaining
part is called the <b>dry substance</b> or <b>dry matter</b>. If the dry
matter is burned in an ordinary fire, only the <b>ash</b> remains;
<i>this ash came from the soil</i>. The part that passed off as
gas in the burning <i>contained the elements that came from
the air</i>; it also contained some of those that came from
the soil—all those (as nitrogen, hydrogen, chlorine) that
are transformed into gases by the heat of a common fire.
The part that comes from the soil (the ash) is small in
amount, being considerably less than 10 per cent and
sometimes less than 1 per cent. <i>Water is the most
abundant single constituent or substance of plants.</i> In a
corn plant of the roasting-ear stage, about 80 per cent of
the substance is water. A fresh turnip is over 90 per
cent water. Fresh wood of the apple tree contains about
45 per cent of water.</p>

<p><b>Carbon</b>.—<i>Carbon enters abundantly into the composition
of all plants.</i> Note what happens when a plant is burned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
without free access of air, or smothered, as in a charcoal
pit. <i>A mass of charcoal remains, almost as large as the
body of the plant.</i> Charcoal is almost pure <i>carbon</i>, the ash
present being so small in proportion to the large amount
of carbon that we look on the ash as an impurity. Nearly
half of the dry substance of a tree is carbon. Carbon
goes off as <i>a gas</i> when the plant is <i>burned in air</i>. It does
not go off alone, but in combination with oxygen in the
form of <i>carbon dioxide</i> gas, CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p><b>The green plant secures its carbon from the air.</b> In
other words, much of the <i>solid matter</i> of the plant comes
from <i>one of the gases of the air</i>. By volume, <i>carbon dioxide
forms only a small fraction of 1 per cent. of the air</i>.
It would be very disastrous to animal life, however, if this
percentage were much increased, for it excludes the life-giving
oxygen. Carbon dioxide is often called “foul gas.”
It may accumulate in old wells, and an experienced person
will not descend into such wells until they have been tested
with a torch. If the air in the well will not support combustion,—that
is, if the torch is extinguished,—it usually
means that carbon dioxide has drained into the place. The
air of a closed schoolroom often contains far too much of
this gas, along with little solid particles of waste matters.
Carbon dioxide is often known as carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p><b>Appropriation of the Carbon.</b>—<i>The carbon dioxide of the
air readily diffuses itself into the leaves and other green
parts of the plant.</i> The leaf is delicate in texture, and when
very young the air can diffuse directly into the tissues.
The stomates, however, are the special inlets adapted for
the admission of gases into the leaves and other green
parts. Through these stomates, or diffusion-pores, the outside
air enters into the air-spaces of the plant, and is finally
absorbed by the little cells containing the living matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span></p>

<p><b><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Chlorohyll" id="Chlorophyll">Chlorophyll</ins></b> (“leaf green”) is the agent that secures
the energy by means of which carbon dioxide is utilized.
This material is contained in the leaf cells in the form of
grains (p. <a href="#Page_86">86</a>); the grains themselves are protoplasm, only
the colouring matter being chlorophyll. The <i>chlorophyll
bodies or grains are often most abundant near the upper
surface of the leaf, where they can secure the greatest
amount of light</i>. Without this green colouring matter,
there would be no reason for the large flat surfaces which
the leaves possess, and no reason for the fact that the
leaves are borne most abundantly at the ends of branches,
where the light is most available. Plants with coloured
leaves as coleus, have chlorophyll, but it is masked by
other colouring matter. This other colouring matter is
usually soluble in hot water: boil a coleus leaf and notice
that it becomes green and the water becomes coloured.</p>

<p><i>Plants grown in darkness are yellow and slender, and
do not reach maturity.</i> Compare the potato sprouts that
have grown from a tuber lying in a dark cellar with
those that have grown normally in the bright light.
The shoots have become slender, and are devoid of chlorophyll;
and when the food that is stored in the tuber is
exhausted these shoots will have lived useless lives. A
plant that has been grown in darkness from the seed will
soon die, although for a time the little seedling will grow
very tall and slender. Why? <i>Light favours the production
of chlorophyll</i>, and the chlorophyll is the agent in the making
of <i>the organic carbon compounds</i>. Sometimes chlorophyll
is found in buds and seeds, but in most cases these
places are not perfectly dark. Notice how potato tubers develop
chlorophyll, or become green, when exposed to light.</p>

<p><b>Photosynthesis.</b>—<i>Carbon dioxide diffuses into the leaf;
during sunlight it is used, and oxygen is given off.</i> How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the carbon dioxide which is thus absorbed may be used in
making an organic food is a complex question, and need not
be studied here; but it may be stated that carbon dioxide
and water are the constituents. Complex compounds are
built up out of simpler ones.</p>

<p><i>Chlorophyll absorbs certain light rays, and the energy
thus directly or indirectly obtained is used by the living
matter in uniting the carbon dioxide absorbed from the air
with some of the water brought up from the roots. The
ultimate result usually is starch.</i> The process is obscure,
but sugar is generally one step; and our first definite
knowledge of the product begins when starch is deposited
in the leaves. The process of using the carbon dioxide of
the air has been known as carbon assimilation, but the
term now most used is <b>photosynthesis</b> (from two Greek
words meaning <i>light</i> and <i>placing together</i>.)</p>

<p><b>Starch and Sugar.</b>—<i>All starch is composed of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen</i> (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>. The sugars and the
substance of cell walls are very similar to it in composition.
All these substances are called <b>carbohydrates</b>. In making
fruit sugar from the carbon and oxygen of carbon dioxide
and from the hydrogen and oxygen of the water, <i>there
is a surplus of oxygen</i> (6 parts CO<sub>2</sub> + 6 parts H<sub>2</sub>O
= C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6 O<sub>2</sub>). It is this oxygen that is given off
into the air during sunlight.</p>

<p><b>Digestion.</b>—<i>Starch is in the form of insoluble granules.
When such food material is carried from one part of the
plant to another for purposes of growth or storage, it is
made soluble before it can be transported.</i> When this
starchy material is transferred from place to place, it is
usually changed into sugar by the action of a diastase.
<i>This is a process of</i> <b>digestion</b>. It is much like the change
of starchy foodstuffs to sugary foods effected by the saliva.</p>

by a Wire.</span> See Fig. <a href="#Page_85">85</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Distribution of the Digested Food.</b>—After being changed
to the soluble form, <i>this material is ready to be used in
growth</i>, either in the leaf, in the stem, or in the roots.
With other more complex products it is then <i>distributed
throughout all the growing parts
of the plant</i>; and when passing
down to the root, it seems to pass
more readily through the <i>inner
bark</i>, in plants which have a definite
bark. This gradual downward
diffusion through the inner
bark of materials suitable for
growth is the process referred to
when the “descent of sap” is mentioned.
Starch and other products
are often <i>stored in one growing
season to be used in the next season</i>.
If a tree is constricted or
strangled by a wire around its
trunk (Fig. <a href="#fig118">118</a>), the digested food
cannot readily pass down and it is stored above the girdle,
causing an enlargement.</p>

<p><b>Assimilation.</b>—<i>The food from the air and that from the
soil unite in the living tissues.</i> The “sap” that passes
upwards from the roots in the growing season is made up
largely of the soil water and the salts which have been
absorbed in the diluted solutions (p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>). This upward-moving
water is conducted largely through certain tubular
canals of the <i>young wood</i>. These cells are never continuous
tubes from root to leaf; but the water passes readily
from one cell or canal to another in its upward course.</p>

<p>The upward-moving water gradually passes to the growing
parts, and everywhere in the living tissues, it is, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
course, in the most intimate contact with the soluble carbohydrates
and products of photosynthesis. In the building
up or reconstructive and other processes it is therefore
available. We may properly conceive of certain of the
simpler organic molecules as passing through a series of
changes, gradually increasing in complexity. There will
be formed substances containing nitrogen in addition to
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Others will contain also
sulphur and phosphorus, and the various processes may
be thought of as culminating in <b>protoplasm</b>. <i>Protoplasm
is the living matter in plants.</i> It is in the cells, and is
usually semi-fluid. Starch is not living matter. The
complex process of building up the protoplasm is called
<b>assimilation</b>.</p>

<p><b>Respiration.</b>—<i>Plants need oxygen for respiration, as
animals do.</i> We have seen that plants need the carbon
dioxide of the air. To most plants the nitrogen of the air
is inert, and serves only to dilute the other elements; but
the <i>oxygen is necessary for all life</i>. We know that all
animals need this oxygen in order to breathe or respire.
In fact, they have become accustomed to it in just the
proportions found in the air; and this is now best for
them. When animals breathe the air once, they make it
foul, because they use some of the oxygen and give off
carbon dioxide. Likewise, <i>all living parts of the plant must
have a constant supply of oxygen</i>. Roots also need it, for
they respire. Air goes in and out of the soil by diffusion,
and as the soil is heated and cooled, causing the air to
expand and contract.</p>

<p>The oxygen passes into the air-spaces and is absorbed
by the moist cell membranes. In the living cells it makes
possible the formation of simpler compounds by which
energy is released. This energy enables the plant to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
work and grow, and the final products of this action are
<i>carbon dioxide and water</i>. As a result of the use of this
oxygen by night and by day, plants give off carbon dioxide.
<i>Plants respire; but since they are stationary, and more or
less inactive, they do not need so much oxygen as animals do,
and they do not give off so much carbon dioxide</i>. A few
plants in a sleeping room need not disturb one more than a
family of mice. It should be noted, however, that germinating
seeds respire vigorously, hence they consume much oxygen;
and opening buds and flowers are likewise active.</p>

<p><b>Transpiration.</b>—Much more water is absorbed by the
roots than is used in growth, <i>and this surplus water passes
from the leaves into the atmosphere by an evaporation process
known as</i> <b>transpiration</b>. Transpiration takes place more
abundantly from the under surfaces of leaves, and through
the pores or stomates. A sunflower plant of the height
of a man, during an active period of growth, gives off a
quart of water per day. A large oak tree may transpire
150 gallons per day during the summer. For every ounce
of dry matter produced, it is estimated that 15 to 25 pounds
of water usually passes through the plant.</p>

<p><i>When the roots fail to supply to the plant sufficient water
to equalize that transpired by the leaves</i>, <b>the plant wilts</b>.
Transpiration from the leaves and delicate shoots is increased
by all the conditions which increase evaporation,
such as higher temperature, dry air, or wind. The
stomata open and close, tending to regulate transpiration
as the varying conditions of the atmosphere affect the
moisture content of the plant. However, in periods of
drought or of very hot weather, and especially during a
hot wind, the closing of these stomates cannot sufficiently
prevent evaporation. The roots may be very active and
yet fail to absorb sufficient moisture to equalize that given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
off by the leaves. The plant shows the effect (how?).
On a hot dry day, note how the leaves of corn “roll” towards
afternoon. Note how fresh and vigorous the same
leaves appear early the following morning. Any injury to
the roots, such as a bruise, or exposure to heat, drought, or
cold may cause the plant to wilt.</p>

<p>Water is forced up by <b>root pressure</b> or <b>sap pressure</b>.
(Exercise 99.) Some of the dew on the grass in the morning
may be the water forced up by the roots; some of it is
the condensed vapour of the air.</p>

<p><i>The wilting of a plant is due to the loss of water from
the cells.</i> The cell walls are soft, and collapse. A toy
balloon will not stand alone until it is inflated with air
or liquid. In the woody parts of the plant the cell walls
may be stiff enough to support themselves, even though
the cell is empty. Measure the contraction due to wilting
and drying by tracing a fresh leaf on page of notebook,
and then tracing the same leaf after it has been
dried between papers. The softer the leaf, the greater
will be the contraction.</p>

<p><b>Storage.</b>—We have said that starch may be stored in
twigs to be used the following year. The very early flowers
on fruit trees, especially those that come before the leaves,
and those that come from bulbs, as crocuses and tulips,
are supported by the starch or other food that was organized
the year before. Some plants have very special storage
reservoirs, as the potato, in this case being a thickened
stem although growing underground. (Why a thickened
stem? p. <a href="#Page_84">84</a>.) It is well to make the starch test on winter
twigs and on all kinds of thickened parts, as tubers and bulbs.</p>

</figure>

<p><b>Carnivorous Plants.</b>—Certain plants capture insects and
other very small animals and utilize them to some extent
as food. Such are the sundew, which has on the leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
sticky hairs that close over the insect; the Venus’s fly-trap
of the Southern States, in which the halves of the leaves
close over the prey like the jaws
of a steel trap; and the various
kinds of pitcher plants that collect
insects and other organic
matter in deep, water-filled, flask-like
leaf pouches (Fig. <a href="#fig119">119</a>).</p>

<p>The sundew and the Venus’s
fly-trap are sensitive to contact.
Other plants are <i>sensitive to the
touch</i> without being insectivorous.
The common cultivated
sensitive plant is an example.
This is readily grown from seeds
(sold by seedsmen) in a warm
place. Related wild plants in
the south are sensitive. The
utility of this sensitiveness is not understood.</p>


<p><b>Parts that Simulate Leaves.</b>—We have learned that
leaves are endlessly modified to suit the conditions in which
the plant is placed. The most marked modifications are in
adaptation to light. On the other hand, <i>other organs often
perform the functions of leaves</i>. Green shoots function as
leaves. These shoots may look like leaves, in which case
they are called <i>cladophylla</i>. The foliage of common
asparagus is made up of fine branches: the real morphological
leaves are the minute dry functionless scales at the
bases of these branchlets. (What reason is there for calling
them leaves?) The broad “leaves” of the florist’s smilax
are cladophylla. Where are the leaves on this plant? In
most of the cacti, the entire plant body performs the functions
of leaves until the parts become cork-bound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>

<p><b>Leaves are sometimes modified to perform other functions
than the vital processes</b>: they may be tendrils, as the
terminal leaflets of pea and sweet pea; or spines, as in
barberry. Not all spines and thorns, however, represent
modified leaves: some of them (as of hawthorns, osage
orange, honey locust) are branches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suggestions.</span>—<i>To test for chlorophyll.</i> <b>84.</b> Purchase about a
gill of wood alcohol. Secure a leaf of geranium, clover, or other
plant that has been exposed to sunlight for a few hours, and, after
dipping it for a minute in boiling water, put it in a white cup with
sufficient alcohol to cover. Place the cup in a shallow pan of
hot water on the stove where it is not hot enough for the alcohol
to take fire. After a time the chlorophyll is dissolved by the
alcohol which has become an intense green. Save this leaf for
the starch experiment (Exercise 85). Without chlorophyll, the
plant cannot appropriate the carbon dioxide of the air. <i>Starch
and photosynthesis.</i> <b>85.</b> Starch is present in the green leaves
which have been exposed to sunlight; but in the dark no starch
can be formed from carbon dioxide. Apply iodine to the leaf from
which the chlorophyll was dissolved in the previous experiment.
Note that the leaf is coloured purplish-brown throughout. The leaf
contains starch.<b>86.</b> Secure
a leaf from a plant
which has been in the
dark for about two days.
Dissolve the chlorophyll as
before, and attempt to stain
this leaf with iodine. No
purplish-brown colour is produced.
This shows that
the starch manufactured in
the leaf may be entirely
removed during darkness. </p>

a morning of bright sunshine dissolve the chlorophyll in this leaf
with alcohol; then stain the leaf with the iodine. Notice that the
leaf is stained deeply except where the cork was; there sunlight and
carbon dioxide were excluded, Fig. <a href="#fig120_121">121</a>. There is no starch in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>

Have the funnel considerably
smaller than the vessel, and support
the funnel well up from the

<p>Thus far we have spoken of plants that have roots and foliage and
that depend on themselves. They collect the raw materials and make
them over into assimilable food. They are <b>independent</b>. Plants
without green foliage cannot make food; they must have it made for
them or they die. They are <b>dependent</b>. A sprout from a potato
tuber in a dark cellar cannot collect and elaborate carbon dioxide.

<p><i>All plants with naturally
white or blanched
parts are dependent.</i> Their leaves do not develop. They
live on organic matter—that which has been made by a
plant or elaborated by an animal. The dodder, Indian
pipe, beech drop, coral root among flower-bearing plants,
also mushrooms and other fungi (Figs. <a href="#fig131">131</a>, <a href="#fig132">132</a>) are examples.
The dodder is common in swales, being conspicuous
late in the season from its thread-like yellow or orange
stems spreading over the herbage of other plants. One
kind attacks alfalfa and is a bad pest. The seeds germinate
in the spring, but as soon as the twining stem attaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
itself to another plant, the dodder
dies away at the base and becomes
wholly dependent. It produces flowers
in clusters and seeds itself freely
(Fig. <a href="#fig133">133</a>).</p>

<p>The threads of a parasitic fungus
usually creep through the intercellular
spaces in the leaf or the stem and send
suckers (or haustoria) into the cells
(Fig. <a href="#fig132">132</a>). The threads (or the hyphæ)
clog the air-spaces of the leaf
and often plug the stomates,
and they also appropriate and
disorganize the cell fluids; <i>thus
they injure or kill their host</i>. The mass of hyphæ
of a fungus is called <b>mycelium</b>. Some of the
hyphæ finally grow out of the leaf and produce
spores or reproductive cells that answer
the purpose of seeds in distributing
the plant (<i>b</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig132">132</a>).</p>

<p>A plant that lives on dead or decaying
matter is a <b>saprophyte</b>. Mushrooms
(Fig. <a href="#fig131">131</a>) are examples; they
live on the decaying matter in the
soil. Mould on bread and cheese is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
example. Lay a piece of moist bread on a plate and
invert a tumbler over it. In a few days it will be mouldy.
The spores were in the air, or perhaps they had already
fallen on the bread but had not had opportunity to grow.
Most green plants are unable to make any direct use of
the humus or vegetable mould in the soil, for they are not
saprophytic. The shelf fungi
(Fig. <a href="#fig134">134</a>) are saprophytes.
They are common
on logs and trees.
Some of them are perhaps
partially parasitic, extending
the mycelium into the
wood of the living tree
and causing it to become
black-hearted (Fig. <a href="#fig134">134</a>).</p>

<p>Some parasites spring
from the ground, as other
plants do, but they are
<i>parasitic on the roots of
their hosts</i>. Some parasites
may be <i>partially
parasitic</i> and <i>partially
saprophytic</i>. Many (perhaps
most) of these
ground saprophytes are
aided in securing their
food by soil fungi, which spread their delicate threads over
the root-like branches of the plant and act as intermediaries
between the food and the saprophyte. These fungus-covered
roots are known as <b>mycorrhizas</b> (meaning “fungus
root”). Mycorrhizas are not peculiar to saprophytes.
They are found on many wholly independent plants, as,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
for example, the heaths, oaks, apples, and pines. It is
probable that the fungous threads perform some of the
offices of root-hairs to the
host. On the other hand,
the fungus obtains some
nourishment from the
host. The association
seems to be mutual.</p>

known as bacteria (Fig. <a href="#fig135">135</a>). These innumerable
organisms are immersed in water or in dead animals and
plants, and in all manner of
moist organic products. By
breaking down organic
combinations, <i>they produce
decay</i>. Largely through
their agency, and that of
many true but microscopic
fungi, <i>all things pass into
soil and gas</i>. Thus are the
bodies of plants and animals
removed and the continuing
round of life is maintained.</p>

<p><i>Some parasites are green-leaved.</i>
Such is the mistletoe
(Fig. <a href="#fig136">136</a>). They anchor
themselves on the host and

<p><b>Epiphytes.</b>—To be distinguished from the dependent
plants are those that grow on other plants without taking
food from them. These are green-leaved plants whose
roots burrow in the bark of the host plant and perhaps
derive some food from it, but which subsist chiefly on
materials that they secure from air dust, rain water, and
the air. These plants are <b>epiphytes</b> (meaning “upon
plants”) or air-plants.</p>

<p>Epiphytes abound in the tropics. Certain orchids are
among the best known examples (Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>). The Spanish
moss or tillandsia of the South is another. Mosses and
lichens that grow on trees and fences may also be called
epiphytes. In the struggle for existence, the plants
probably <i>have been driven to these special places</i> in which
to find opportunity to grow. Plants grow where they
must, not where they will.</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">WINTER AND DORMANT BUDS</span></h2>
</div>



<p><b>A bud is a growing point</b>, terminating an axis either long
or short, or being the starting point of an axis. <i>All
branches spring from buds.</i> In the growing season the
bud is active; later in the season it ceases to increase the
axis in length, and as winter approaches the growing
point becomes more or less thickened and covered by protecting
scales, in preparation for the long resting season.
This resting, dormant, or winter body is what is commonly
spoken of as a “bud.” A winter bud may be defined
as an <i>inactive covered growing point</i>, waiting for spring.</p>

<p><i>Structurally, a dormant bud is a</i> <b>shortened axis</b> <i>or</i> <b>branch</b>,
<i>bearing miniature leaves or flowers or both, and protected
by a covering</i>. Cut in two, lengthwise, a
bud of the horse-chestnut or other plant
that has large buds. With a pin separate
the tiny leaves. Count them.
Examine the big bud of the
rhubarb as it lies under the
ground in late winter or early
spring; or the crown buds of
asparagus, hepatica, or other
early spring plants. Dissect
large buds of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: apple" id="apple">apricot</ins>
and pear (Figs. <a href="#fig137">137</a>, <a href="#fig138">138</a>).</p>

<p><i>The bud is protected by firm and dry scales.</i> These
scales are modified leaves. The scales fit close. Often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
the bud is protected by varnish (see horse-chestnut and
the balsam poplars). Most winter buds are more or less
woolly. Examine some of them under a lens. As we might
expect, bud coverings are most prominent in cold and dry
climates. Sprinkle water on velvet or flannel, and note
the result and give a reason.</p>

<p><b>All winter buds give rise to branches</b>, <i>not to leaves alone</i>;
that is, the leaves are borne on the lengthening axis.
Sometimes the axis, or branch, remains very short,—so
short that it may not be noticed. Sometimes it grows
several feet long.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 139.—Leaf-Scars.</span>—Ailanthus.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>Whether the branch grows large or not depends on the
chance it has</i>,—position on the plant, soil, rainfall, and
many other factors. The new shoot is the
unfolding and enlarging of the tiny axis
and leaves that we saw in the bud. If the
conditions are congenial, the shoot may
form more leaves than were tucked away
in the bud. The length of the shoot usually
depends more on the length of the
internodes than on the number of leaves.</p>

<p><b>Where Buds are.</b>—<i>Buds are borne in the</i>
<b>axils</b> <i>of the leaves</i>,—in the acute angle
that the leaf makes with the stem. When
the leaf is growing in the summer, a bud
is forming above it. When the leaf falls,
the bud remains, and a scar marks the
place of the leaf. Fig. <a href="#fig139">139</a> shows the large leaf-scars of
ailanthus. Observe those on the horse-chestnut, maple,
apple, pear, basswood, or any other tree or bush.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 140.—Terminal
Bud

</figure>

<p>Sometimes two or more buds are borne in one axil; the
extra ones are <b>accessory</b> or <b>supernumerary</b> buds. Observe
them in the Tartarian honeysuckle (common in yards),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
walnut, butternut, red maple, honey locust, and sometimes
in the apricot and peach.</p>

<p>If the bud is at the end of a shoot, however short the
shoot, it is called a <b>terminal bud</b>. <i>It continues the growth
of the axis in a direct line.</i> Very often
three or more buds are clustered at the tip
(Fig. <a href="#fig140">140</a>); and in this case there may be
more buds than leaf-scars. Only one of
them, however, is strictly terminal.</p>

<p>A bud in the axil of a leaf is an <b>axillary</b>
or <b>lateral</b> bud. Note that there is normally
at least one bud in the axil of every leaf on
a tree or shrub in late summer and fall. The
axillary buds, if they grow, are the <i>starting
points of new shoots the following season</i>. If
a leaf is pulled off early in summer, what
will become of the young bud in its axil?
Try this.</p>

<p>The buds that appear on roots are unusual or abnormal,—they
occur only occasionally and in no definite order.
Buds appearing in unusual places on any part of the plant
are called <b>adventitious buds</b>. Such usually are the buds
that arise when a large limb is cut off, and
from which suckers
or water-sprouts
arise.</p>

<p><b>How Buds Open.</b>—<i>When the bud swells, the scales are
pushed apart, the little axis elongates and pushes out.</i> In most
plants the outside scales fall very soon, <i>leaving a little ring of
scars</i>. With terminal buds, this ring marks the end of the year’s
growth. How? Notice peach, apple, plum, willow, and other plants. In
some others, all the scales grow for a time, as in the pear (Figs.
<a href="#fig142_143">142, 143</a>, <a href="#fig144">144</a>). In other plants the inner bud scales become green and
almost leaf-like. See the maple and hickory.</p>

<p>Buds that contain or
produce only leaves are

or <b>fruit-buds</b>. The latter occur on
peach, almond, apricot, and many very

apricot bud in Fig. <a href="#fig146_147_148">147</a>. A longitudinal

<p><i>Fruit buds are usually thicker or

In some plants (apple, pear) they are

and the sleepers wake.</p>

<p><b>Arrangement of Buds.</b>—We have found that leaves are
usually arranged in a definite order; buds are borne in the
axils of leaves: therefore <i>buds must exhibit phyllotaxy</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Moreover, branches grow from buds: branches, therefore,
should show a definite arrangement. Usually, however, they
do not show this arrangement because <i>not all the buds grow
and not all the branches live</i>. (See Chaps. II and III.)
It is apparent, however, that the mode of arrangement of
buds determines to some extent the form of the tree. Compare
bud arrangement in pine or fir with that in maple or
apple.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 154.—Oak Spray.</span> How are the leaves borne with reference to

</figure>

<p>The uppermost buds on any twig, if they are well
matured, are usually the larger and stronger and they are
the most likely to grow the next spring; therefore, branches
tend to be arranged in tiers (particularly well marked in
spruces and firs). See Fig. <a href="#fig154">154</a> and explain it.</p>

<p><b>Winter Buds show what has been the Effect of Sunlight.</b>—Buds
are borne in the axils of the leaves, and <i>the size or the
vigour of the leaf determines to a large extent the size of the
bud</i>. Notice that, in most instances, <i>the largest buds are
nearest the tip</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig157">157</a>). If the largest buds are not
near the tip, there is some special reason for it. Can you
state it? Examine the shoots on trees and bushes.</p>

study of branches, he should look for three things: the ages of
the various parts, the relative positions of the buds and the leaves, the
different sizes of similar or comparable buds. If it is late in
spring or early in summer, he should watch the development of
the buds in the axils, and he should determine whether the
strength or size of the bud is in any way related to the size and
the vigour of the subtending (or supporting) leaf. The sizes of buds
should also be noted on leafless twigs, and the sizes of the former
leaves may be inferred from the size of the leaf-scar below the
bud. The pupil should keep in mind the fact of the struggle
for food and light, and its effects on the developing buds.</p>

<p><b>124.</b> <i>The bud and the branch.</i> A twig cut from an apple tree
in early spring is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig155_6">155</a>. The most hasty observation
shows that it has various parts, or members. It seems to
be divided at the point <i>f</i> into two parts. It is evident that the
part from <i>f</i> to <i>h</i> grew last year, and that the part below <i>f</i> grew
two years ago. The buds on the two parts are very unlike,
and these differences challenge investigation.—In order to understand
this seemingly lifeless twig, it will be necessary to see it as
it looked late last summer (and this condition is shown in Fig.
<a href="#fig155_6">156</a>). The part from <i>f</i> to <i>h</i>,—which has just completed its
growth,—is seen to have its leaves growing singly. In every axil
(or angle which the leaf makes when it joins the shoot) is a bud.
The leaf starts first, and as the season advances the bud forms in
its axil. When the leaves have fallen, at the approach of winter,
the buds remain, as seen in Fig. <a href="#fig155_6">155</a>. Every bud on the last
year’s growth of a winter twig, therefore, marks the position
occupied by a leaf when the shoot was growing.—The part below
<i>f</i>, in Fig. <a href="#fig155_6">156</a>, shows a wholly different arrangement. The leaves
are two or more together (<i>aaaa</i>), and there are buds without
leaves (<i>bbbb</i>). A year ago this part looked like the present shoot
from <i>f</i> to <i>h</i>,—that is, the leaves were single, with a bud in the
axil of each. It is now seen that some of these bud-like parts
are longer than others, and that the longest ones are those which
have leaves. It must be because of the leaves that they have
increased in length. The body <i>c</i> has lost its leaves through some
accident, and its growth has ceased. In other words, the parts
at <i>aaaa</i> are like the shoot <i>fh</i>, except that they are shorter, and
they are of the same age. One grew from the end or terminal
bud of the main branch, and the others from the side or lateral
buds. Parts or bodies that bear leaves are, therefore, branches.—The
buds at <i>bbbb</i> have no leaves, and they remain the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
size that they were a year ago. They are dormant. The only way
for a mature bud to grow is by making leaves for itself, for a leaf
will never stand below it again. The twig, therefore, has buds of
two ages,—those at <i>bbbb</i> are two seasons old, and those on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
tips, of all the branches (<i>aaaa</i>, <i>h</i>), and in the axil of every leaf,
are one season old. It is only the terminal buds that are not
axillary. When the bud begins to grow and to put forth leaves,
it gives rise to a branch, which, in its turn, bears buds.—It will
now be interesting to determine why certain buds gave rise to
branches and why others remained dormant. The strongest
shoot or branch of the year is the terminal one (<i>fh</i>). The
next in strength is the uppermost lateral one, and the weakest
shoot is at the base of the twig. The dormant buds are on the
under side (for the twig grew in a horizontal position). All this
suggests that those buds grew which had the best chance,—the
most sunlight and room. There were too many buds for the space,
and in the struggle for existence those that had the best opportunities
made the largest growth. This struggle for existence
began a year ago, however, when the buds on the shoot below <i>f</i>
were forming in the axils of the leaves, for the buds near the tip
of the shoot grew larger and stronger than those near its base.
The growth of one year, therefore, is very largely determined by
the conditions under which the buds were formed the previous
year. <i>Other bud characters.</i> <b>125.</b> It is easy to see the swelling
of the bud in a room in winter. Secure branches of trees and
shrubs, two to three feet long, and stand them in vases or jars,
as you would flowers. Renew the water frequently and cut off
the lower ends of the shoots occasionally. In a week or two the
buds will begin to swell. Of red maple, peach, apricot, and other
very early-flowering things, flowers may be obtained in ten to
twenty days. <b>126.</b> The shape, size, and colour of the winter buds
are different in every kind of plant. By the buds alone botanists
are often able to distinguish the kinds of plants. Even such
similar plants as the different kinds of willows have good bud
characters. <b>127.</b> Distinguish and draw fruit-buds of apple, pear,
peach, plum, and other trees. If different kinds of maples grow
in the vicinity, secure twigs of the red or swamp maple, and the
soft or silver maple, and compare the buds with those of the sugar
maple and the Norway maple. What do you learn?</p>

</div>


<p>We have learned (in Chap. VI) that plants propagate
by means of seeds. <i>They also propagate by means of bud
parts,—as rootstocks (rhizomes), roots, runners, layers, bulbs.</i>
The pupil should determine how any plant in which he is
interested naturally propagates itself (or spreads its kind).
Determine this for raspberry, blackberry, strawberry, June-grass
or other grass, nut-grass, water-lily, May apple or
mandrake, burdock, Irish potato, sweet potato, buckwheat,
cotton, pea, corn, sugar-cane, wheat, rice.</p>

<p>Plants may be <i>artificially propagated</i> by similar means,
as by <i>layers</i>, <i>cuttings</i>, and <i>grafts</i>. The last two we may
discuss here.</p>

<p><b>Cuttings in General.</b>—<i>A bit of a plant stuck into the
ground stands a chance of growing; and this bit is a</i> <b>cutting</b>.
Plants have preferences, however, as to the kind of bit
which shall be used, but <i>there is no way of telling what this
preference is except by trying</i>. In some instances this preference
has not been discovered, and we say that the plant
cannot be propagated by cuttings.</p>

<p>Most plants prefer that the cutting be made of the <b>soft</b>
or <b>growing parts</b> (called “wood” by gardeners), of which
the “slips” of geranium and coleus are examples. Others
grow equally well from cuttings of the <b>hard</b> or <b>mature parts</b>
or <b>wood</b>, as currant and grape; and in some instances this
mature wood may be of roots, as in the blackberry. In
some cases cuttings are made of tubers, as in the Irish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
potato (Fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>). Pupils should make cuttings now and
then. If they can do nothing more, they can make cuttings
of potato, as the farmer does; and they can plant
them in a box in the window.</p>

<p><b>The Softwood Cutting.</b>—The softwood cutting is made
from tissue that is still growing, or at least from that
which is not dormant. <i>It comprises one or two joints, with
a leaf attached</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig158_9">158, 159</a>). It must not be allowed
to wilt. Therefore, it must be <i>protected from direct sunlight
and dry air until it is well established; and if it has
many leaves, some of them should be removed, or at least cut
in two, in order to reduce the evaporating surface.</i> The
soil should be uniformly moist. The pictures show the
depth to which the cuttings are planted.</p>

<p>For most plants, the proper age or maturity of wood for
the making of cuttings may be determined by giving the
<i>twig a quick bend: if it snaps and hangs by the bark, it is in
proper condition; if it bends without breaking, it is too
young and soft or too old; if it splinters, it is too old and
woody</i>. The tips of strong upright shoots usually make
the best cuttings. Preferably, each cutting should have a
joint or node near its base; and if the internodes are very
short it may comprise two or three joints.</p>

<p><i>The stem of the cutting is inserted one third or more of its
length in clean sand or gravel, and the earth is pressed firmly
about it.</i> A newspaper may be laid over the bed to exclude
the light—if the sun strikes it—and to prevent too
rapid evaporation. The soil should be moist clear through,
not on top only.</p>

<p><i>Loose sandy or gravelly soil is used.</i> Sand used by
masons is good material in which to start most cuttings; or
fine gravel—sifted of most
of its earthy matter—may
be used. Soils are avoided
which contain much decaying
organic matter, for these
soils are breeding places of
fungi, which attack the soft
cutting and cause it to “damp
off,” or to die at or near the surface of the ground. If the
cuttings are to be grown in a window, put three or four
inches of the earth in a shallow box or a pan. A soap
box cut in two lengthwise, so that it makes a box four or
five inches deep—as a gardener’s flat—is excellent (Fig.
<a href="#fig160">160</a>). Cuttings of common plants, as geranium, coleus,
fuchsia, carnation, are kept at a
living-room temperature. As long
as the cuttings look bright and
green, they are in good condition.
It may be a month before roots
form. When roots have formed,
the plants begin to make new
leaves at the tip. Then they may
be transplanted into other boxes
or into pots. The verbena in Fig. <a href="#fig161">161</a> is just ready for
transplanting.</p>

<p>It is not always easy to
find growing shoots from
which to make the cuttings.
The best practice,
in that case, is <i>to cut back
an old plant, then keep it
warm and well watered,
and thereby force it to throw
out new shoots</i>. The old
geranium plant from the
window garden, or the one
taken up from the lawn
bed, may be treated this
way (see Fig. <a href="#fig162">162</a>). The
best plants of geranium
and coleus and most window
plants are those which are not more than one year
old. <i>The geranium
and fuchsia cuttings
which are
made in January,
February, or March
will give compact
blooming plants for
the next winter;
and thereafter new
ones should take
their places</i> (Fig.
<a href="#fig163">163</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Hardwood
Cutting.</b>—<i>Best results
with cuttings
of mature wood are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
secured when the cuttings are made in the fall and then
buried until spring in sand in the cellar.</i> These cuttings
are usually six to ten inches long. They are not idle while
they rest. The lower end calluses or heals, and the roots
form more readily when the cutting is planted in the
spring. But if the proper season has passed, take cuttings
at any time in winter, plant them in a deep
box in the window, and watch. They will
need no shading or special care. Grape,
currant, gooseberry, willow, and poplar
readily take root from the hardwood.
Fig. <a href="#fig164">164</a> shows a currant cutting. It has
only one bud above the ground.</p>

Cutting.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>The Graft.</b>—<i>When the cutting is inserted
in a plant rather than in the soil, it is a
graft</i>; and the graft may grow. In this
case the cutting grows fast to the other
plant, and the two become one. When
the cutting is inserted in a plant, it is no
longer called a cutting but a <b>scion</b>; and the
plant in which it is inserted is called the
<b>stock</b>. Fruit trees are grafted <i>in order
that a certain variety or kind may be perpetuated</i>,
as a Baldwin or Ben Davis variety
of apple, Seckel or Bartlett pear, Navel
or St. Michael orange.</p>

<p><i>Plants have preferences as to the stocks on which they
will grow; but we can find out what their choice is only
by making the experiment.</i> The pear grows well on the
quince, but the quince does not thrive on the pear.
The pear grows on some of the hawthorns, but it is an
unwilling subject on the apple. Tomato plants will grow
on potato plants and potato plants on tomato plants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
When the potato is the root, both tomatoes and potatoes
may be produced, although the crop will be very small;
when the tomato is the root, neither potatoes nor tomatoes
will be produced. Chestnut will grow on some kinds of
oak. In general, one species or kind is grafted on the
same species, as apple on apple, pear on pear, orange on
orange.</p>

<p><i>The forming, growing tissue of the stem</i> (on the plants
we have been discussing) <i>is the</i> <b>cambium</b> (Chap. X), <i>lying
on the outside of the woody cylinder beneath the bark</i>. In
order that union may take place, <i>the cambium of the scion
and of the stock must come together</i>. Therefore the scion
is set in the side of the stock. There are many ways of
shaping the scion and of preparing the stock to receive it.
These ways are dictated largely by the relative sizes of
scion and stock, although many of them are matters of
personal preference. The underlying principles are two:
securing <i>close contact</i> between the cambiums of scion and
stock; <i>covering the wounded surfaces</i> to prevent evaporation
and to protect the parts from disease.</p>

<p>On large stocks the commonest form of grafting is the
<b>cleft-graft</b>. The stock is cut off and split; and in one or
both sides a wedge-shaped scion is firmly inserted. Fig.
<a href="#fig165_6_7">165</a> shows the scion; Fig. <a href="#fig165_6_7">166</a>, the scions set in the stock;
Fig. <a href="#fig165_6_7">167</a>, the stock waxed. It will be seen that the lower
bud—that lying in the wedge—is covered by the wax;
but being nearest the food supply and least exposed to
weather, it is the most likely to grow: it will push through
the wax.</p>

<p><b>Cleft-grafting</b> <i>is practised in spring, as growth begins.
The scions are cut previously, when perfectly dormant, and
from the tree which it is desired to propagate</i>. The scions
are kept in sand or moss in the cellar. Limbs of various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
sizes may be cleft-grafted,—from a half inch up to four
inches in diameter; but a diameter of one to one and a
half inches is the most convenient size. All the leading
or main branches of a tree top may be grafted. If the
remaining parts of the top are gradually cut away and
the scions grow well, the entire top will be changed over to
the new variety.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another form of grafting is known as <b>budding</b>. In this
case a single bud is used, and it is slipped underneath the
bark of the stock and securely tied (not waxed) with soft
material, as bass bark, corn shuck, yarn, or raffia (the last
a commercial palm fibre). Budding is performed <i>when the
bark of the stock will slip or peel</i> (so that the bud can be
inserted), and <i>when the bud is mature enough to grow</i>.
Usually budding is performed in late summer or early
fall, when the winter buds are well formed; or it may be
practised in spring with buds cut in winter. In ordinary
summer budding (which is the usual mode) the “bud” or
scion forms a union with the stock, and then lies dormant
till the following spring, as if it were still on its own twig.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Budding is mostly restricted to young trees in the nursery.
In the spring following the budding, the stock is cut off
just above the bud, so that only the shoot from the bud
grows to make the future tree. This prevailing form of
budding (shield-budding) is shown in Fig.
<a href="#fig168">168</a>.</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">HOW PLANTS CLIMB</span></h2>
</div>


<p>We have found that plants struggle or contend for a
place in which to live. Some of them become adapted to
grow in the forest shade, others to grow on other plants,
as epiphytes, others to <i>climb to the light</i>. Observe how
woods grapes, and other forest climbers, spread their foliage
on the very top of the forest tree, while their long
flexile trunks may be bare.</p>

<p>There are several ways by which plants climb, but most
climbers may be classified into four groups: (1) <b>scramblers</b>,
(2) <b>root climbers</b>, (3) <b>tendril climbers</b>, (4) <b>twiners</b>.</p>

<p><b>Scramblers.</b>—Some plants rise to light and air <i>by resting
their long and weak stems on the tops of bushes and
quick-growing herbs</i>. Their stems may be elevated in part
by the growing twigs of the plants on which they recline.
Such plants are scramblers. Usually they are provided
with prickles or bristles. In most weedy swamp thickets,
scrambling plants may be found. Briers, some roses, bed-straw
or galium, bittersweet (<i>Solanum Dulcamara</i>, not the
<i>Celastrus</i>) the tear-thumb polygonums, and other plants are
familiar examples of scramblers.</p>

<p><b>Root Climbers.</b>—Some plants climb by means of <i>true
roots</i>. These roots seek the dark places and therefore
enter the chinks in walls and bark. The trumpet creeper
is a familiar example (Fig. <a href="#fig36">36</a>). The true or English
ivy, which is often grown to cover buildings, is another
instance. Still another is the poison ivy. Roots are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
distinguished from stem tendrils by their <i>irregular or
indefinite position</i> as well as by their mode of growth.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 169.—Tendril</span>, to show
where the coil is changed.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Tendril climbers.</b>—A slender coiling part that serves to
hold a climbing plant to a support is known as a <b>tendril</b>.
The free end swings or curves
until it strikes some object, when
it attaches itself and then coils
and <i>draws the plant close to the
support</i>. The spring of the coil
also allows the plant <i>to move in
the wind</i>, thereby enabling the
plant to maintain its hold. Slowly pull a well-matured
tendril from its support, and note how strongly it holds
on. Watch the tendrils in a wind-storm. Usually the tendril
attaches to the support by <i>coiling about it</i>, but the Virginia
creeper and the Boston ivy (Fig. <a href="#fig170">170</a>) attach to walls
by means of <i>disks</i>
on the ends of the
tendrils.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp60" id="fig170">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig170.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 170.—Tendril
of Boston Ivy.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since both ends
of the tendril are
fixed, when it finds
a support, the coiling
would tend to
twist it in two. It
will be found, however,
that the tendril
<i>coils in different directions</i>
in different parts of its length. In Fig. <a href="#fig169">169</a>, showing
an old and stretched-out tendril, the change of direction
in the coil occurred at a. In long tendrils of cucumbers
and melons there may be several changes of direction.</p>

<p>Tendrils may represent either <i>branches</i> or <i>leaves</i>. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Virginia creeper and the grape they are branches; they
stand opposite the leaves in the position of fruit clusters,
and sometimes one branch of a fruit cluster is a tendril.
These tendrils are therefore homologous with fruit clusters,
and fruit clusters are branches.</p>

a <b>twiner</b>. Examples are bean, hop, morning-glory, moon-flower,
false bittersweet or waxwork (<i>Celastrus</i>), some
honeysuckles, wistaria, Dutchman’s pipe, dodder. The
free tip of the twining branch <i>sweeps about in curves</i>, much
as the tendril does, until it finds support or becomes old
and rigid.</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">THE FLOWER—ITS PARTS AND FORMS</span></h2>
</div>



<p>The function of the flower is to <i>produce seed</i>. It is
probable that all its varied forms and colours contribute
to this supreme end. These forms and colours please the
human fancy and add to the joy of living, but the flower
exists for the good of the plant, not for the good of man.
The parts of the flower are of two general kinds—those
that are directly concerned in the <i>production of seeds</i>, and
those that act as <i>covering and protecting organs</i>. The
former parts are known as the <b>essential organs</b>; the latter
as the <b>floral envelopes</b>.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp30" id="fig173">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig173.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption caphang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 173.—Flower of
a Buttercup in Section.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Envelopes.</b>—The floral envelopes usually bear a close
resemblance to leaves. These envelopes are very commonly
of two series or kinds—the
<i>outer</i> and the <i>inner</i>. The outer series,
known as the <b>calyx</b>, is usually smaller
and green. It usually comprises the
outer cover of the flower-bud. The
calyx is the lowest whorl in Fig. <a href="#fig173">173</a>.</p>

<p>The inner series, known as the
<b>corolla</b>, is usually coloured and more
special or irregular in shape than the calyx. It is the
showy part of the flower, as a rule. The corolla is the
second or large whorl in Fig. <a href="#fig173">173</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>calyx</i> may be composed of several leaves. Each
leaf is a <b>sepal</b>. If it is of one piece, it may be lobed or
divided, in which case the divisions are called <b>calyx-lobes</b>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
In like manner, the corolla may be composed of <b>petals</b>, or
it may be of one piece and variously lobed. A calyx of
one piece, no matter how deeply lobed, is <b>gamosepalous</b>.
A corolla of one piece is <b>gamopetalous</b>. When these
series are of separate pieces, as in Fig. <a href="#fig173">173</a>, the flower is
said to be <b>polysepalous</b> and <b>polypetalous</b>. Sometimes both
series are of separate parts, and
sometimes only one of them is so
formed.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp40" id="fig174">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig174.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 174.—Flower of
Fuchsia in Section.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>The floral envelopes are homologous with leaves.</i> Sepals
and petals, at least when more than three or five, are in more than
one whorl, and one whorl stands below another so that the parts
overlap. They are borne on the expanded or thickened end of the
flower stalk; this end is the <b>torus</b>. In Fig. <a href="#fig173">173</a> all the
parts are seen as attached to the torus. This part is sometimes
called the <i>receptacle</i>, but this word is a common-language
term of several meanings, whereas torus has no other meaning.
Sometimes one part is attached to another part, as in the fuchsia
(Fig.<a href="#fig174"> 174</a>), in which the petals are borne on the calyx-tube.</p>

<p><b>Subtending Parts.</b>—Sometimes there are <i>leaf-like parts
just below the calyx</i>, looking like a second calyx. Such
parts accompany the carnation flower. These parts are
<b>bracts</b> (bracts are small specialized leaves); and they form
an <b>involucre</b>. We must be careful that we do not mistake
them for true flower-parts. Sometimes the bracts are
large and petal-like, as in the great white blooms of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
flowering dogwood: here the real flowers are several,
small and greenish, forming a small cluster in the centre.</p>

<p><b>Essential Organs</b>.—The essential organs are of two
series. The outer series is composed of the <b>stamens</b>. The
inner series is composed of the <b>pistils</b>.</p>

<p><i>Stamens</i> bear the <b>pollen</b>, which is made up of grains or
spores, each spore usually being a single plant cell. The
stamen is of two parts, as is readily seen in Figs. <a href="#fig173">173</a>,
<a href="#fig174">174</a>,—the enlarged terminal part or <b>anther</b>, and the stalk
or <b>filament</b>. The filament is often so short as to seem to
be absent, and the anther is then said to be <i>sessile</i>. The
anther bears the pollen spores. It is made up of two or
four parts (known as sporangia or spore-cases), which
burst and discharge the
pollen. <i>When the pollen is
shed, the stamen dies.</i></p>

 The pistil consists of the ovary, the style and the stigma.
  It contains the seed part. The stamens are tipped with anthers, in
  which the pollen is borne. The ovary, <i>o</i>, ripens into the
  fruit.
 </div> 
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <i>pistil has three
parts</i>: the lowest, or seed-bearing
part, which is the
<b>ovary</b>; the <b>stigma</b> at the
upper extremity, which is
a flattened or expanded
surface, and usually roughened
or sticky; the stalk-like
part or <b>style</b>, connecting
the ovary and the stigma.
Sometimes the style is apparently wanting, and the
stigma is said to be sessile on the ovary. These parts are
shown in the fuchsia (Fig. <a href="#fig174">174</a>). The ovary or seed vessel
is at <i>a</i>. A long style, bearing a large stigma, projects from
the flower. See also Figs. <a href="#fig175">175</a> and <a href="#fig176">176</a>.</p>

<p>Stamens and pistils probably are homologous with leaves.
A pistil is sometimes conceived to represent anciently a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
leaf as if rolled into a tube; and an anther, a leaf of which
the edges may have been turned in on the midrib.</p>

<p><b>Various Forms of Corolla.</b>—The corolla often assumes
very definite or distinct forms, especially when gamopetalous.
It may have a long tube with a wide-flaring limb,
when it is said to be <b>funnelform</b>, as in morning-glory
and pumpkin. If the tube is very narrow and the limb
stands at right angles to it, the corolla is <b>salverform</b>, as
in phlox. If the tube is very short and the limb wide-spreading
and nearly circular in outline, the corolla is
<b>rotate</b> or <b>wheel-shaped</b>, as in potato.</p>

<p>A gamopetalous corolla or gamosepalous calyx is often
cleft in such way as to make two prominent parts. Such
parts are said to be <b>lipped</b> or <b>labiate</b>. Each of the lips or
lobes may be notched or toothed. In 5-membered flowers,
the lower lip is usually 3-lobed and the upper one 2-lobed.
Labiate flowers are characteristic of the mint family (Fig.
<a href="#fig183_4_5">185</a>), and the family therefore is called the Labiatæ. (Literally,
labiate means merely “lipped,” without specifying the
number of lips or lobes; but it is commonly used to designate
2-lipped flowers.) Strongly 2-parted polypetalous
flowers may be said to be labiate; but the term is oftenest
used for gamopetalous corollas.</p>

<p>Labiate gamopetalous flowers
that are closed in the throat (or
entrance to the tube) are said to
be grinning or <b>personate</b> (personate
means <i>masked</i>). Snapdragon
is a typical example;
also toadflax or butter-and-eggs (Fig. <a href="#fig186">186</a>), and many

relations to insect pollination. Observe how an

<p><b>Spathe Flowers.</b>—In many plants, very simple (often
naked) flowers are borne in dense, more or less fleshy
spikes, and the spike is inclosed in or attended by a leaf,
sometimes corolla-like, known as a <b>spathe</b>. The spike of
flowers is technically known as a <b>spadix</b>. This type of
flower is characteristic of the great arum family, which is
chiefly tropical. The commonest wild representatives are
Jack-in-the-pulpit, or Indian turnip, and skunk cabbage. In
the former the flowers are all diclinous and naked. In the
skunk cabbage all the flowers are perfect and have four sepals.
The common calla is a good example of this type of
inflorescence.</p>

of several or many little flowers, or</i> <b>florets</b>. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
florets are inclosed in a more or less dense and usually
green <i>involucre</i>. In the thistle (Fig. <a href="#fig190">190</a>) this involucre is
prickly. A longitudinal
section discloses the florets,
all attached at bottom
to a common torus,
and densely packed in
the involucre. The pink
tips of these florets constitute
the showy part of
the head.</p>

</figure>

<p>Each floret of the thistle
(Fig. <a href="#fig190">190</a>) is a complete
flower. At <i>a</i> is the ovary. At <i>b</i> is a much-divided
plumy calyx, known as the <b>pappus</b>. The corolla is long-tubed,
rising above the pappus, and is enlarged and 5-lobed
at the top, <i>c</i>. The style projects
at <i>e</i>. The five anthers
are united about the style in
a ring at <i>d</i>. Such anthers
are said to be <b>syngenesious</b>.
These are the various parts
of the florets of the Compositæ.
In some cases the
pappus is in the form of
barbs, bristles, or scales, and
sometimes it is wanting.
The pappus, as we shall see
later, assists in distributing
the seed. Often the florets
are not all alike. The corolla
of those in the outer circles may be developed into a <i>long,
straplike, or tubular part</i>, and the head then has the appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
of being one flower with a border of petals. Of
such is the sunflower (Fig. <a href="#fig189">189</a>), aster, bachelor’s button or
cornflower, and field daisy (Fig. <a href="#fig211">211</a>). These long corolla-limbs
are called <b>rays</b>. In some cultivated composites, all
the florets may develop rays, as in the dahlia and the chrysanthemum.
In some species, as dandelion, all the florets
naturally have rays. Syngenesious arrangement of anthers
is the most characteristic single feature of the
composites.</p>

<p><b>Double Flowers.</b>—Under the stimulus of cultivation and
increased food supply, flowers tend to become double.
True doubling arises
in two ways, morphologically:
(1) <i>stamens
or pistils may
produce petals</i> (Fig.
<a href="#fig191">191</a>); (2) <i>adventitious
or accessory
petals may arise in
the circle of petals</i>.
Both these categories
may be present
in the same
flower. In the full
double hollyhock the petals derived from the staminal column
are shorter and make a rosette in the centre of the
flower. In Fig. <a href="#fig192">192</a> is shown the doubling of a daffodil
by the modification of stamens. Other modifications of
flowers are sometimes known as doubling. For example,
double dahlias, chrysanthemums, and sunflowers are forms
in which the disk flowers have developed rays. The snowball
is another case. In the wild snowball the external
flowers of the cluster are large and sterile. In the cultivated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
plant all the flowers have become large and sterile.
Hydrangea is a similar case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suggestions.</span>—<b>145.</b> If the pupil has been skilfully conducted
through this chapter <i>by means of careful study of specimens</i> rather
than as a mere memorizing process, he will be in mood to challenge
any flower that he sees and to make an effort to understand
it. Flowers are endlessly modified in form; but they can be
understood if the pupil looks first for the anthers and ovaries.
How may anthers and ovaries always be distinguished? <b>146.</b> It is
excellent practice to find the flowers in plants that are commonly
known by name, and to determine the main points in their structure.
What are the flowers in Indian corn? pumpkin or squash?
celery? cabbage? potato? pea? tomato? okra? cotton? rhubarb?
chestnut? wheat? oats? <b>147.</b> Do all forest trees have flowers?
Explain. <b>148.</b> Name all the monœcious plants you know.
Diœcious. <b>149.</b> What plants do you know that bloom before
the leaves appear? Do any bloom after the leaves fall? <b>150.</b> Explain

</figure>

<p><b>Fertilization.</b>—<i>Seeds result from the union of two elements
or parts.</i> One of these elements is a cell-nucleus
of the pollen-grain. The other element
is the cell-nucleus of an egg-cell,
borne in the ovary. The
pollen-grain falls on the stigma
(Fig. <a href="#fig193">193</a>). It absorbs the juices
exuded by the stigma, and grows
by sending out a tube (Fig. <a href="#fig194">194</a>).
This tube grows downward through
the style, absorbing food as it goes,
and finally reaches the egg-cell in
the interior of an ovule in the
ovary (Fig. <a href="#fig195">195</a>), and <b>fertilization</b>,
or union of a nucleus of the pollen and the
nucleus of the egg-cell in the ovule, takes place.
<i>The ovule and embryo within then develops
into a seed.</i> The growth of the pollen-tube is
often spoken of as germination of the pollen,
but it is not germination in the sense in which
the word is used when speaking of seeds.</p>

Tube.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Better seeds—that is, those that produce
stronger and more fruitful plants—often result
when the <i>pollen comes from another flower</i>.
Fertilization effected between different flowers
is cross-fertilization; that resulting from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
application of pollen to pistils in the same flower is <b>close-fertilization</b>
or <b>self-fertilization</b>. It will be seen that the
cross-fertilization relationship may be of many degrees—between
two flowers in the same cluster, between those
in different clusters on the same
branch, between those on different
plants. Usually fertilization takes
place only between plants of the
same species or kind.</p>

<p>In many cases there is, in effect,
<i>an apparent selection of pollen</i> when
pollen from two or more sources is
applied to the stigma. Sometimes
the foreign pollen, if from the same
kind of plant, grows, and fertilization
results, while pollen from the
same flower is less promptly effective.
If, however, no foreign pollen
is present, the pollen from the
same flower may finally serve the
same purpose.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In order that the pollen may grow, <i>the stigma must be
ripe</i>. At this stage the stigma is usually moist and sometimes
sticky. A ripe stigma is said to be <b>receptive</b>. The
stigma may remain receptive for several hours or even
days, depending on the kind of plant, the weather, and how
soon pollen is received. Watch a certain flower every day
to see the anther locules open and the stigma ripen. When
fertilization takes place, the stigma dies. Observe, also,
how soon the petals wither after the stigma has received
pollen.</p>

<p><b>Pollination.</b>—The transfer of the pollen from anther
to stigma is known as <b>pollination</b>. The pollen may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
fall of its own weight on the adjacent stigma, or it
may be carried from flower to flower by wind, insects, or
other agents. There may be <b>self-pollination</b> or <b>cross-pollination</b>,
and of course it must always precede fertilization.</p>

<figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 196.—Anther of
Azalea</span>, opening by terminal pores.</figcaption>

</figure><p>Usually the pollen is discharged by the bursting
of the anthers. The commonest method of
discharge is through a <i>slit</i> on either side of the
anther (Fig. <a href="#fig193">193</a>). Sometimes it discharges
through a <i>pore</i> at the apex, as in azalea (Fig.
<a href="#fig196">196</a>), rhododendron, huckleberry, wintergreen.
In some plants a part of the anther wall raises
or falls as a <i>lid</i>, as in barberry (Fig. <a href="#fig197">197</a>), blue
cohosh, May apple. The opening of an anther
(as also of a seed-pod) is known as <b>dehiscence</b> (<i>de</i>, from;
<i>hisco</i>, to gape). When an anther or seed-pod opens, it is
said to <i>dehisce</i>.</p>

<p><i>Most flowers are so constructed as to increase the chances
of cross-pollination.</i> We have seen that the stigma may
have the power of choosing foreign pollen. The
commonest means of necessitating cross-pollination
is the <i>different times of maturing of stamens
and pistils in the same flower</i>. In most cases
the stamens mature first: the flower is then
<b>proterandrous</b>. When the pistils mature first,
the flower is <b>proterogynous</b>. (<i>Aner</i>, <i>andr</i>, is a
Greek root often used, in combinations, for stamen,
and <i>gyne</i> for pistil.) The difference in
time of ripening may be an hour or two, or it
may be a day. The ripening of the stamens
and the pistils at different times is known as <b>dichogamy</b>, and
flowers of such character are said to be dichogamous.
There is little chance for dichogamous flowers to pollinate
themselves. Many flowers are <i>imperfectly dichogamous</i>—some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
of the anthers mature simultaneously with the pistils,
so that there is chance for self-pollination in case foreign
pollen does
not arrive. Even
when the stigma
receives pollen
from its own
flower, cross-fertilization
may
result. The hollyhock
is proterandrous.

<p><i>Some flowers are so constructed as to prohibit self-pollination.</i>
Very irregular flowers are usually of this kind.
With some of them,
the petals form a
sac to inclose the
anthers and the pollen
cannot be shed
on the stigma but is
retained until a bee
forces the sac open;
the pollen is rubbed
on the hairs of the
bee and transported.
Regular flowers usually
depend mostly on dichogamy and the selective power
of the pistil to insure crossing. <i>Flowers that are very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
irregular and provided with nectar and strong perfume are
usually pollinated by insects.</i> Gaudy colours probably attract
insects in many cases, but perfume appears to be a
greater attraction.</p>

<p>The insect <i>visits the flower for the
nectar</i> (for the making of honey) <i>and
may unknowingly carry the pollen</i>.
Spurs and sacs in the flower are <b>nectaries</b>
(Fig. <a href="#fig200">200</a>), but in spurless flowers
the nectar is usually secreted <i>in the
bottom of the flower cup</i>. This compels
the insect to pass by the anther and
rub against the pollen before it reaches
the nectar. Sometimes the anther is a
long lever poised on the middle point and the insect
bumps against one end and lifts
it, thus bringing the other end
of the lever with the pollen sacs
down on its back. Flowers that
are pollinated by insects are said
to be <b>entomophilous</b> (“insect loving”).
Fig. <a href="#fig200">200</a> shows a larkspur.
The envelopes are separated in
Fig. <a href="#fig201">201</a>. The long spur at once
suggests insect pollination. The
spur is a sepal. Two hollow
petals project into this spur, apparently
serving to guide the
bee’s tongue. The two smaller
petals, in front, are peculiarly
coloured and perhaps serve the bee in locating the nectary.
The stamens ensheath the pistils (Fig. <a href="#fig202">202</a>). As the insect
stands on the flower and thrusts its head into the centre,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
the envelopes are pushed downward and outward and
the pistil and stamens come in contact with its abdomen.
Since the flower is proterandrous, the
pollen that the pistils receive from the
bee’s abdomen must come from another
flower. Note a somewhat similar arrangement
in the toadflax or butter-and-eggs.</p>

<p>In some cases (Fig. <a href="#fig203">203</a>) the stamens
are longer than the pistil in one flower
and shorter in another. If the insect
visits such flowers, it gets pollen on its
head from the long-stamen flower, and
deposits this pollen on the stigma in the
long-pistil flower. Such flowers are <b>dimorphous</b>
(of two forms). If pollen from its own flower
and from another flower both fall on the stigma, the probabilities
are that the stigma will choose the foreign pollen.</p>

<p><i>Many flowers are pollinated by the wind.</i> They are said
to be <b>anemophilous</b> (“wind loving”). Such flowers produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
great quantities of pollen, for much of it is wasted.
They usually have broad stigmas, which expose large
surfaces to the wind. They are usually lacking in gaudy
colours and in perfume. Grasses and pine trees are typical
examples of anemophilous plants.</p>

<p>In many cases cross-pollination is assured because the
<i>stamens and the pistils are in different flowers</i>
(diclinous). Monœcious and diœcious plants may be pollinated by
wind or insects, or other agents (Fig. <a href="#fig204">204</a>). They are usually
wind-pollinated, although willows are often, if not mostly,
insect-pollinated. The Indian corn is a monœcious plant. The
staminate flowers are in a terminal panicle (tassel). The
pistillate flowers are in a dense spike (ear),
inclosed in a sheath or husk. Each “silk” is a style.
Each pistillate flower produces a kernel of corn. Sometimes
a few pistillate flowers are borne in the tassel and a
few staminate flowers on the tip of the ear. Is self-fertilization
possible with the corn? Why does a “volunteer”
stalk standing alone in a garden have only a few grains
on the ear? What is the direction of the prevailing wind
in summer? If only two or three rows of corn are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
planted in a garden where prevailing winds occur, in which
direction had they better run?</p>

<p>Although most flowers are of such character as to insure
or increase the chances of cross-pollination, there are some
<i>that absolutely forbid crossing</i>. These flowers are usually
borne beneath or on the
ground, and they lack
showy colours and perfumes.
They are known
as <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers
(meaning self-fertilizing
flowers). The plant has
normal showy flowers
that may be insect-pollinated,
and in addition
is provided with these
simplified flowers. Only
a few plants bear cleistogamous
flowers. Hog-peanut,
common blue
violet, fringed wintergreen,
and dalibarda are
the best subjects in
this country. Fig.
<a href="#fig205">205</a> shows a cleistogamous
flower of the blue
violet at <i>a</i>. Above the
true roots, slender stems bear these flowers, that are
provided with a calyx, and a curving corolla which does
not open. Inside are the stamens and the pistils. Late in
the season the cleistogamous flowers may be found just
underneath the mould. They never rise above ground.
The following summer one may find a seedling plant, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
some kinds of plants, with the remains of the old cleistogamous
flower still adhering to the root. Cleistogamous
flowers usually appear after the showy flowers have
passed. They seem to insure a crop of seed by a
method that expends little of the plant’s energy. The
pupil will be interested to work out the fruiting of the peanut
(Fig. <a href="#fig206">206</a>).
Unbaked fresh
peanuts grow
readily and can
easily be raised
in Canada, in
a warm sandy
garden.</p>

<i>Not all the
flowers produce
seeds.</i> Note that
an apple tree may
bloom very full,
but that only relatively
few apples
may result (Fig. <a href="#fig207">207</a>). <i>More pollen is produced than is needed to
fertilize the flowers</i>; this increases the chances that sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
stigmas will receive acceptable pollen to enable the plant to
perpetuate its kind. At any time in summer, or even in fall,
examine the apple trees carefully to determine whether any dead
flowers or flower stalks still remain about the apple; or, examine
any full-blooming plant to see whether any of the flowers fail.
<b>153.</b> Keep watch on any plant to see whether insects visit it.
What kind? When? What for? <b>154.</b> Determine whether the
calyx serves any purpose in protecting the flower. Very carefully
remove the calyx from a bud that is normally exposed to heat
and sun and rain, and see whether the flower then fares as well as
others. <b>155.</b> Cover a single flower on its plant with a tiny paper
or muslin bag so tightly that no insect can get in. If the flower
sets fruit, what do you conclude? <b>156.</b> Remove carefully the
corolla from a flower nearly ready to open, preferably one that has
no other flowers very close to it. Watch for insects. <b>157.</b> Find
the nectar in any flower that you study. <b>158.</b> Remove the stigma.
What happens? <b>159.</b> Which of the following plants have perfect
flowers: pea, bean, pumpkin, cotton, clover, buckwheat, potato,
Indian corn, peach, chestnut, hickory, watermelon, sunflower, cabbage,
rose, begonia, geranium, cucumber, calla, willow, cottonwood,
cantaloupe? What have the others? <b>160.</b> On wind-pollinated
plants, are either anthers or stigmas more numerous?
<b>161.</b> Are very small coloured flowers usually borne singly or in

the fruit crop? <b>163.</b> Of what value are bees in orchards?
<b>164.</b> <i>The crossing of plants to improve varieties or to obtain new
varieties.</i>—It may be desired to perform the operation of pollination
by hand. In order to insure the most definite results,
every effort should be made rightly to apply the pollen which it
is desired shall be used, and rigidly to exclude all other pollen.
(<i>a</i>) The first requisite is to remove the anthers from the flower
which it is proposed to cross, and they <i>must be removed before the
pollen has been shed</i>. The flower-bud is therefore opened and the
anthers taken out. Cut off the floral envelopes with small, sharp-pointed
scissors, then cut out or pull out the anthers, leaving only
the pistil untouched; or merely open the corolla at the end and
pull out the anthers with a hook or tweezers; and this method is
often the best one. It is best to delay the operation as long as
possible and yet not allow the bud to open (and thereby expose
the flower to foreign pollen) nor the anthers to discharge the
pollen. (<i>b</i>) <i>The flower must next be covered with a paper bag to
prevent the access of pollen</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig208">208</a>, <a href="#fig209">209</a>). If the stigma is not
receptive at the time (as it usually is not), the desired pollen is
not applied at once. The bag may be removed from time to time
to allow of examination of the pistil, and when the stigma is
mature, which is told by its glutinous or roughened appearance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
the time for pollination has come. If the bag is slightly moistened,
it can be puckered more tightly about the stem of the plant.
The time required for the stigma to mature varies from several
hours to a few days. (<i>c</i>) When the stigma is ready, an unopened
anther from the desired flower is crushed on the finger nail or a
knife blade, and the pollen is rubbed on the stigma by means of a
tiny brush, the point of a knife blade, or a sliver of wood. The
flower is <i>again covered with the bag</i>, which is allowed to remain
for several days until all danger of other pollination is past. Care
must be taken completely to cover the stigmatic surface with
pollen, if possible. The seeds produced by a crossed flower produce
<i>hybrids</i>, or plants having parents belonging to different
varieties or species. <b>165.</b> One of the means of securing new
forms of plants is by making hybrids. Why?</p>

</div>



<p><b>Origin of the Flower-cluster.</b>—We have seen that
branches arise from the axils of leaves. Sometimes the
leaves may be reduced to bracts
and yet branches are borne in
their axils. Some of the branches
grow into long limbs; others become
short spurs; <i>others bear
flowers</i>. In fact, a flower is itself
a specialized branch.</p>

  211.—Terminal Flowers of the Whiteweed</span> (in some places
  called ox-eye daisy).</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Flowers are usually borne
near the top of the plant. Often
they are produced in great numbers.
It results, therefore, that
flower branches usually stand
close together, forming a <b>cluster</b>.
The shape and the arrangement
of the flower-cluster <i>differ
with the kind of plant</i>, since
each plant has its own mode of
branching.</p>


<p>Certain definite or well-marked
types of flower-clusters have received
names. Some of these
names we shall discuss, but the
flower-clusters that perfectly match the definitions are the
exception rather than the rule. The determining of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
kinds of flower-clusters is one of the most perplexing subjects
in descriptive botany. We may classify the subject
around three ideas: <b>solitary flowers</b>, <b>centrifugal</b> or <b>determinate
clusters</b>, <b>centripetal</b> or <b>indeterminate clusters</b>.</p>

an Abutilon.</span> A greenhouse
plant.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Solitary Flowers.</b>—In many cases flowers are borne
singly; they are separated from other flowers by leaves.
They are then said to be <b>solitary</b>. The solitary flower may
be either at the end of the
main shoot or axis (Fig. <a href="#fig211">211</a>),
when it is said to be <b>terminal</b>;
or from the side of the shoot
(Fig. <a href="#fig212">212</a>), when it is said to
be <b>lateral</b> or <b>axillary</b>.</p>

<p><b>Centripetal Clusters.</b>—If
the flower-bearing axils were
rather close together, an open
or leafy flower-cluster might
result. If the plant continues
to grow from the tip, the
older flowers are left farther
and farther behind. If the
cluster were so short as to be
flat or convex on top, the outermost
flowers would be the
older. A flower-cluster in which the lower or outer flowers
open first is said to be a <b>centripetal cluster</b>. It is sometimes
said to be an <b>indeterminate</b> cluster, since it is the
result of a type of growth which may go on more or less
continuously from the apex.</p>

<p>The simplest form of a definite centripetal cluster is a
<b>raceme</b>, which is an open elongated cluster in which the
<i>flowers are borne singly on very short branches</i> and open
from below (that is, from the older part of the shoot)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
upwards (Fig. <a href="#fig213">213</a>). The raceme may be <i>terminal</i> to the
main branch; or it may be <i>lateral</i> to it, as in Fig. <a href="#fig214">214</a>.
Racemes often bear the
flowers on one side of
the stem, thus forming
a single row.</p>

Plantain.</span></figcaption>

</figure>
  <p>When a centripetal flower-cluster is long and dense and the
  flowers are sessile or nearly so, it is called a <b>spike</b>
  (Fig. <a href="#fig215">215</a>). Common examples of spikes are plantain, mignonette,
  mullein.</p>

</figure>



<p>A very <i>short and
dense spike</i> is a <b>head</b>.
Clover (Fig. <a href="#fig216">216</a>) is
a good example. The
sunflower and related
plants bear many
small flowers in a
very dense and often flat head. Note that in the
sunflower (Fig. <a href="#fig189">189</a>) the outside or exterior flowers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
open first. Another special form of spike is the <b>catkin</b>,
which usually has scaly bracts, the whole cluster being
deciduous after flowering or fruiting, and the flowers (in
typical cases) having only stamens or pistils. Examples
are the “pussies” of willows (Fig.
<a href="#fig182">182</a>) and flower-clusters of oak (Fig.
<a href="#fig180">180</a>), walnuts (Fig.<a href="#fig204"> 204</a>), poplars.</p>

</figure>

<p>When a loose, elongated centripetal flower-cluster has
some primary branches simple, and others irregularly
branched, it is called a <b>panicle</b>. It is a branching raceme.
Because of the earlier growth of the lower branches, the
panicle is usually broadest at the base or conical in outline.
True panicles are not very common.</p>

<p>When an indeterminate flower-cluster is short, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
the <i>top is convex or flat</i>, it is a <b>corymb</b> (Fig. <a href="#fig217">217</a>). The
outermost flowers open first. Centripetal flower-clusters
are sometimes said to be corymbose in mode.</p>

<p>When the branches of an indeterminate cluster <i>arise from
a common point</i>, like the frame of an umbrella, the cluster
is an <b>umbel</b> (Fig. <a href="#fig218">218</a>). Typical umbels occur in carrot,
parsnip, caraway, and other plants of the parsley family:
the family is known as the Umbelliferæ, or umbel-bearing
family. In the carrot and many other Umbelliferæ, there
are small or secondary umbels, called <b>umbellets</b>, at the end
of each of the main branches. (In the centre of the wild
carrot umbel one often finds a single, blackish, often
aborted flower, comprising a 1-flowered umbellet.)</p>

</figure>

<p><b>Centrifugal or Determinate Clusters.</b>—When the terminal
or central flower opens first, the cluster is said to be
<b>centrifugal</b>. The growth of the shoot or cluster is <b>determinate</b>,
since the length is definitely determined or stopped
by the terminal flower. Fig. <a href="#fig219">219</a> shows a determinate or
centrifugal mode of flower bearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption caphang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 219.—Determinate or
Cymose Arrangement.</span>—Wild
geranium.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Dense centrifugal clusters are
usually flattish on top because of
the cessation of growth in the
main or central axis. These compact
flower-clusters are known
as <b>cymes</b>. Centrifugal clusters
are sometimes said to be cymose
in mode. Apples, pears (Fig.
<a href="#fig220">220</a>), and elders bear flowers in
cymes. Some cyme-forms are
like umbels in general appearance.
A head-like cymose cluster
is a <b>glomerule</b>; it blooms from
the top downwards rather than
from the base upwards.</p>

<p><b>Mixed Clusters.</b>—Often the cluster is mixed, being
determinate in one part and indeterminate in another part of the same
cluster. The main cluster may be indeterminate, but the branches
determinate. The cluster has the appearance of a panicle, and is
usually so called, but it is really a <b>thyrse</b>. Lilac is a
familiar example of a thyrse. In some cases the main cluster is
determinate and the branches are indeterminate, as in hydrangea and
elder.</p>

</figure>

<p><b>Inflorescence.</b>—The <i>mode</i> or
<i>method</i> of flower arrangement is
known as the <b>inflorescence</b>. That
is, the inflorescence is cymose, corymbose,
paniculate, spicate, solitary, determinate, indeterminate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>By custom, however, the word “inflorescence”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
has come to be used in works on descriptive botany for
the <i>flower-cluster itself</i>. Thus a cyme or a panicle may be
called an inflorescence. It will be seen that even solitary
flowers follow either indeterminate or determinate methods
of branching.</p>

<p><b>The flower-stem.</b>—The stem of a solitary flower is
known as a <b>peduncle</b>; also the general stem of a <i>flower-cluster</i>.
The stem of the individual flower in a cluster is
a <b>pedicel</b>. In the so-called stemless plants the peduncle
may arise directly from the ground, or crown of the plant,
as in dandelion, hyacinth, garden daisy; this kind of

should be examined, for the pupil must never receive the impression
that all flower-clusters follow the definitions in books. Clusters
of some of the commonest plants are very puzzling, but the
pupil should at least be able to discover whether the inflorescence
is determinate or indeterminate. Figures 221 to 223 illustrate the

<p>The ripened ovary, with its attachments, is known as the
fruit. <i>It contains the seeds.</i> If the pistil is simple, or of
one carpel, the fruit
also will have one compartment.
If the pistil
is compound, or of
more than one carpel,
the fruit usually has an
equal number of compartments.
The compartments
in pistil and
fruit are known as <b>locules</b>
(from Latin <i>locus</i>,
meaning “a place”).</p>

first stage in complexity
is a ripened <i>2- or

<i>attachment of other parts to the ovary</i>. Sometimes the style
persists and becomes a beak (mustard pods, dentaria,
Fig. <a href="#fig224">224</a>), or a tail as in clematis; or the calyx may be
attached to the ovary; or the ovary may be embedded in
the receptacle, and ovary and receptacle together constitute
the fruit: or an involucre may become a part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
fruit, as possibly in the walnut and the hickory (Fig. <a href="#fig225">225</a>),
and the cup of the acorn (Fig. <a href="#fig226">226</a>). The chestnut and the
beech bear a prickly involucre, but the nuts,
or true fruits, are not grown fast to it, and the involucre
can scarcely be called a part of the fruit. A ripened ovary
is a <b>pericarp</b>. A pericarp to which other parts adhere has
been called an accessory or reënforced fruit. (Page 169.)</p>

<p>Some fruits are <b>dehiscent</b>, or split open at maturity and
liberate the seeds; others are <b>indehiscent</b>, or do not open.
A dehiscent pericarp is called a <b>pod</b>.
The parts into which such
a pod breaks or splits are
known as <b>valves</b>. In indehiscent
fruits the seed is
liberated by the decay of
the envelope, or by the
rupturing of the envelope
by the germinating seed.
Indehiscent winged pericarps
are known as <b>samaras</b> or <b>key fruits</b>. Maple (Fig.

<p>A 1-loculed pericarp which
dehisces along the front edge
(that is, the inner edge, next
the centre of the flower) is a <b>follicle</b>. The fruit of the
larkspur (Fig. <a href="#fig231">231</a>) is a follicle. There are usually five of
these fruits (sometimes three or
four) in each larkspur flower, each
pistil ripening into a follicle. If
these pistils were united, a single
compound pistil would be formed.
Columbine, peony, ninebark, milkweed,
also have follicles.</p>

Peas and beans are typical examples
(Fig. <a href="#fig232">232</a>); in fact, this character gives
name to the pea family,—Leguminosæ.
Often the valves of the
legume twist forcibly and
expel the seeds, throwing
them some distance. The
word “pod” is sometimes restricted to
legumes, but it is better to use it generically
for all dehiscent pericarps.</p>

<a href="#fig236">236</a>, <a href="#fig237">237</a>). Some capsules are of one
locule, but they may have been compound
when young (in the ovary stage) and the
partitions may have vanished. Sometimes
one or more of the carpels are uniformly
crowded out by the exclusive growth of
other carpels (Fig. <a href="#fig235">235</a>). The seeds or
parts which are crowded out are said to
be <i>aborted</i>.</p>

<p>There are several ways in which capsules
dehisce or open. When they break
<i>along the partitions</i> (or septa), the mode is known as <b>septicidal
dehiscence</b> (Fig. <a href="#fig236">236</a>);
In septicidal dehiscence the
fruit separates into parts
representing the original
carpels. These carpels
may still be entire, and
they then dehisce individually,
usually along the inner
edge as if they were follicles. When the compartments
<i>split in the middle, between the
partitions</i>, the mode is <b>loculicidal
dehiscence</b> (Fig. <a href="#fig237">237</a>). In some
cases the dehiscence is <i>at the top</i>,
when it is said to be <b>apical</b> (although
several modes of dehiscence
are here included). When
the <i>whole top comes off</i>, as in purslane
and garden portulaca (Fig.
<a href="#fig238">238</a>), the pod is known as a <b>pyxis</b>. In some cases apical
dehiscence is by means of a hole or clefts.</p>

2-carpeled, with a thin partition, each locule containing

<p>The pericarp may be <i>fleshy and

berry (Figs. <a href="#fig239">239</a>, <a href="#fig240">240</a>, <a href="#fig241">241</a>). To
the horticulturist a berry is a
small, soft, edible fruit, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
particular reference to its structure. The botanical and
horticultural conceptions of a berry are, therefore, unlike.
In the botanical sense, gooseberries, currants, grapes, tomatoes,
potato-balls, and even eggplant fruits and oranges
(Fig. <a href="#fig241">241</a>) are berries; strawberries, raspberries, blackberries
are not.</p>

<p>A fleshy pericarp containing one relatively large seed
or stone is a <b>drupe</b>. Examples are plum (Fig. <a href="#fig242">242</a>), peach,
cherry, apricot, olive. The walls of
the pit in the plum, peach, and cherry
are formed from the inner coats of
the ovary, and the flesh from the
outer coats. Drupes are also known
as <i>stone-fruits</i>.</p>

<p>Fruits that are formed by the subsequent
union of separate pistils are
<b>aggregate fruits</b>. The carpels in
aggregate fruits are usually more or less fleshy. In the raspberry
and the blackberry flower, the pistils are essentially
distinct, but as the
pistils ripen they cohere
and form one
body (Figs. <a href="#fig243">243</a>, <a href="#fig244">244</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p>
Each of the carpels or pistils in the
raspberry and the blackberry is a
little drupe or <b>drupelet</b>. In the
raspberry the entire fruit separates
from the torus, leaving the torus on
the plant. In the blackberry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the dewberry the fruit adheres to the torus, and the two are
removed together when the fruit is picked.</p>

<p><b>Accessory Fruits.</b>—When the pericarp and some other
part grow together, the fruit is said to be <b>accessory</b> or
<b>reënforced</b>. An example is the strawberry
(Fig. <a href="#fig245">245</a>). The edible part is a
greatly <i>enlarged torus</i>, and the pericarps
are akenes embedded in it. These akenes
are commonly called seeds.</p>

</figure>

<p>Various kinds of reënforced fruits have
received special names. One of these is
the <b>hip</b>, characteristic of roses. In this
case, the torus is deep and hollow, like an
urn, and the separate akenes are borne
inside it. The mouth of the receptacle
may close, and the walls sometimes become fleshy; the
fruit may then be mistaken for a berry. The fruit of the
pear, apple, and quince is known as a
<b>pome</b>. In this case the five united carpels are completely
buried in the hollow torus, and the torus makes most of
the edible part of the ripe fruit, while the pistils are represented
by the core (Fig. <a href="#fig246">246</a>). Observe the sepals on the
top of the torus (apex of the fruit) in Fig. <a href="#fig246">246</a>. Note

<p><b>Gymnospermous Fruits.</b>—In pine, spruces, and their kin,
there is no fruit in the sense in which the word is used
in the preceding pages, because <i>there is no ovary</i>. The
ovules are naked or uncovered, in the axils of the scales of
the young cone, and they have neither style nor stigma.
The pollen falls directly on the mouth of the ovule. The
ovule ripens into a seed, which is usually winged. Because
the ovule is not borne in a sac or ovary, these plants are
called <b>gymnosperms</b> (Greek for “naked seeds”). All the
true cone-bearing plants are of this class; also certain
other plants, as red cedar, juniper, yew. The plants are
monœcious or sometimes diœcious. The staminate flowers
are mere naked stamens borne beneath scales, in small
yellow catkins which soon fall. The pistillate flowers are
naked ovules beneath scales on cones that persist (Fig.
<a href="#fig29">29</a>). Gymnospermous seeds may have several cotyledons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note to Teacher.</span>—There are few more interesting subjects
to beginning pupils than fruits,—the pods of many kinds, forms,
and colours, the berries, and nuts. This interest may well be
utilized to make the teaching alive. All common edible fruits
of orchard and vegetable garden should be brought into this discussion.
Of dry fruits, as pods, burs, nuts, collections may be
made for the school museum. Fully mature fruits are best for
study, particularly if it is desired to see dehiscence. For comparison,
pistils and partially grown fruits should be had at the
same time. If the fruits are not ripe enough to dehisce, they
may be placed in the sun to dry. In the school it is well to have
a collection of fruits for study. The specimens may be kept in
glass jars. <i>Always note exterior of fruit and its parts; interior
of fruit with arrangement and attachment of contents.</i></p>

<p>It is to the plant’s advantage to have its seeds distributed
as widely as possible. <i>It has a better chance of surviving
in the struggle for existence.</i> It gets away from competition.
Many seeds and fruits are of such character as to
increase their chances of wide dispersal. The commonest
means of dissemination may be classed under four heads:
<i>explosive fruits</i>; <i>transportation by wind</i>; <i>transportation by

More marked examples are the locust, witch hazel, garden balsam

(touch-me-not), violet, crane’s-bill or wild geranium, bull nettle,
morning-glory, and the oxalis (Fig. <a href="#fig250">250</a>).
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> oxalis is common
in several species in the wild and in cultivation. One of them is
known as wood sorrel. Figure 250 shows the common yellow oxalis.
The pod opens loculicidally. The elastic tissue suddenly contracts
when dehiscence takes place, and the seeds are thrown violently.
The squirting cucumber is easily grown in a garden (procure seeds
of seedsmen), and the fruits discharge the seeds with great force,
throwing them many feet.</p>

<p><b>Wind Travelers.</b>—Wind-transported
seeds are of two general kinds: those

seeds of catalpa (Fig. <a href="#fig251">251</a>) and cone-bearing
trees and the samaras of ash, elm,
tulip tree, ailanthus, and maple; and
those which have <i>feathery buoys</i> or <i>parachutes</i>
to enable them to float in the air.
Of the latter kind are the fruits of many
composites, in which the pappus is
copious and soft. Dandelion and thistle
are examples. The silk of the milkweed
and probably the hairs on the cotton seed
have a similar office, and also the wool of
the cat-tail. Recall the cottony seeds of
the willow and the poplar.</p>

<p><b>Dispersal by Birds.</b>—<i>Seeds of berries and of other
small fleshy fruits are carried far and wide by birds.</i> The
pulp is digested, but the seeds are not injured. Note how
the cherries, raspberries, blackberries, June-berries, and
others spring up in the fence rows, where the birds rest.
Some berries and drupes persist far into winter, when they
supply food to cedar birds, robins, and the winter birds.
Red cedar is distributed by birds. Many of these pulpy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
fruits are agreeable as human food, and some of them
have been greatly enlarged or “improved” by the arts of
the cultivator. The seeds are usually indigestible.</p>

<p><b>Burs.</b>—Many seeds and fruits bear spines, hooks, and
hairs, which <i>adhere to the coats of animals and to clothing</i>.
The burdock has an involucre with hooked scales, containing
the fruits inside. The clotbur is also an involucre.
Both are composite plants, allied to thistles, but the
whole head, rather than the separate
fruits, is transported. In some composite
fruits the pappus takes the
form of hooks and spines, as in the
“Spanish bayonets” and “pitch-forks.”
Fruits of various kinds are
known as “stick tights,” as of the
agrimony and hound’s-tongue. Those
who walk in the woods in late summer
and fall are aware
that plants have means
of disseminating themselves
(Fig. <a href="#fig252">252</a>). If it
is impossible to identify
the burs which one
finds on clothing, the seeds may be planted and specimens
of the plant may then be grown.</p>

if they are not eaten, they may grow. The seeds of many plants
are blown on the snow. The old stalks of weeds, standing through
the winter, may serve to disseminate the plant. Seeds are carried
by water down the streams and along shores. About woollen mills
strange plants often spring up from seed brought in the fleeces.
Sometimes the entire plant is rolled for miles before the winds.
Such plants are “tumbleweeds.” Examples are Russian thistle,
hair grass or tumblegrass (<i>Panicum capillare</i>), cyclone plant
(<i>Cycloloma platyphyllum</i>), and white amaranth (<i>Amarantus

<p>The sporangia are collected into little groups, known as
<b>sori</b> (singular, sorus) or <b>fruit-dots</b>. Each sorus is covered
with a thin scale or shield, known as
an <b>indusium</b>. This indusium separates
from the frond at its edges, and
the sporangia are exposed. Not all
ferns have indusia. The polypode

are naked. In the brake (Fig. <a href="#fig258">258</a>)

<div class="capsml">Archegonia at <i>a</i>; antheridia at <i>b</i>.</div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the under side of the
prothallus two kinds of organs
are borne. These are the
<b>archegonium</b> (containing egg-cells)
and the <b>antheridium</b> (containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
sperm-cells). These organs are minute specialized
parts of the prothallus. Their positions on a particular
prothallus are shown at <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in Fig. <a href="#fig262">262</a>, but in some
ferns they are on separate prothalli (plant diœcious). <i>The
sperm-cells escape from the antheridium and in the water
that collects on the prothallus are carried to the archegonium,
where fertilization of the egg takes place.</i> From the fertilized
egg-cell a plant grows, becoming a “fern.” In
most cases the prothallus soon dies. The prothallus is the
<b>gametophyte</b> (from Greek, signifying the fertilized plant).</p>

<p>The fern plant, arising from the fertilized egg in the
archegonium, becomes a perennial plant, each year producing
spores from its fronds (called the <b>sporophyte</b>); but
these spores—which are merely detached special kinds of
cells—produce the prothallic phase of the fern plant,
from which new individuals arise. <i>A fern is fertilized but
once in its lifetime.</i> The “fern” bears the spore, the
spore gives rise to the prothallus, and the egg-cell of the
prothallus (when fertilized) gives rise to the fern.</p>

<p>A similar <b>alternation of generations</b> runs all through the
vegetable kingdom, although there are some groups of
plants in which it is very obscure or apparently wanting.
It is very marked in ferns and mosses. In algæ (including
the seaweeds) the gametophyte is the “plant,” as
the non-botanist knows it, and the sporophyte is inconspicuous.
<i>There is a general tendency, in the evolution of
the vegetable kingdom, for the gametophyte to lose its relative
importance and for the sporophyte to become larger and
more highly developed.</i> In the seed-bearing plants the
sporophyte generation is the only one seen by the non-botanist.
The gametophyte stage is of short duration and
the parts are small; it is confined to the time of fertilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span></p>

<p>The sporophyte of seed-plants, or the “plant” as we
know it, produces two kinds of spores—one kind becoming
<b>pollen-grains</b> and the other kind <b>embryo-sacs</b>. The
pollen-spores are borne in sporangia, which are united into
what are called <b>anthers</b>. The embryo-sac, which contains
the egg-cell, is borne in a sporangium known as an <b>ovule</b>.
<i>A gametophytic stage is present in both pollen and embryo
sac: fertilization takes place, and a sporophyte arises. Soon
this sporophyte becomes dormant, and is then known as an</i>
<b>embryo</b>. The embryo is packed away within tight-fitting
coats, and the entire body is the <b>seed</b>. When the conditions
are right the seed grows, and the sporophyte grows
into herb, bush, or tree. The utility of the alternation of
generations is not understood.</p>

<p>The spores of ferns are borne on leaves; the spores of
seed-bearing plants are also borne amongst a mass of
specially developed conspicuous leaves known as <b>flowers</b>;
therefore these plants have been known as the <b>flowering
plants</b>. Some of the leaves are developed as envelopes
(calyx, corolla), and others as spore-bearing parts, or <b>sporophylls</b>
(stamens, pistils). But the spores of the lower
plants, as of ferns and mosses, may also be borne in specially
developed foliage, so that the line of demarcation
between flowering plants and flowerless plants is not so
definite as was once supposed. The one definite distinction
between these two classes of plants is the fact that <i>one class
produces seeds and the other does not</i>. The seed-plants are
now often called <b>spermaphytes</b>, but there is no single
coordinate term to set off those which do not bear seeds.
It is quite as well, for popular purposes, to use the terms
<b>phenogams</b> for the seed-bearing plants and <b>cryptogams</b> for
the others. These terms have been objected to in recent
years because their etymology does not express literal facts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
(<i>phenogam</i> signifying “showy flowers,” and <i>cryptogam</i>
“hidden flowers”), but the terms represent distinct ideas
in classification. The cryptogams include three great
series of plants—the <b>Thallophytes</b> or algæ, lichens, and
fungi; the <b>Bryophytes</b> or moss-like plants; the <b>Pteridophytes</b>
or fernlike plants.</p>

complete divisions of a frond are called pinnæ, no matter whether
the frond is pinnate or not. In
ferns the word “pinna” is used in
essentially the same way that leaflet
is in the once-compound leaves
of other plants. The secondary
leaflets are called pinnules, and in
thrice, or more, compound fronds,
the last complete parts or leaflets
are ultimate pinnules. The diagram

<p>The pupil who has acquired skill in the use of the compound
microscope may desire to make more extended excursions
into the cryptogamous orders. The following
plants have been chosen as examples in various groups.
Ferns are sufficiently discussed in the preceding chapter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bacteria</span></h3>

<p>If an infusion of ordinary hay is made in water and allowed to
stand, it becomes turbid or cloudy after a few days, and a drop
under the microscope will show the presence of minute oblong
cells swimming in the water, perhaps by means of numerous hair-like
appendages, that project through the cell wall from the protoplasm
within. At the surface of the dish containing the infusion
the cells are non-motile and are united in long chains. Each
of these cells or organisms is a <i>bacterium</i> (plural, <i>bacteria</i>).
(Fig. <a href="#fig135">135</a>.)</p>

<p>Bacteria are very minute organisms,—the smallest known—consisting
either of separate oblong or spherical cells, or of
chains, plates, or groups of such cells, depending on the kind.
They possess a membrane-like wall which, unlike the cell walls of
higher plants, contains nitrogen. The presence of a nucleus has
not been definitely demonstrated. Multiplication is by the fission
of the vegetative cells; but under certain conditions of drought,
cold, or exhaustion of the nutrient medium, the protoplasm of the
ordinary cells may become invested with a thick wall, thus forming
an <i>endospore</i> which is very resistant to extremes of environment.
No sexual reproduction is known.</p>

<p>Bacteria are very widely distributed as parasites and saprophytes
in almost all conceivable places. <i>Decay</i> is largely caused
by bacteria, accompanied in animal tissue by the liberation of
foul-smelling gases. Certain species grow in the reservoirs and
pipes of water supplies, rendering the water brackish and often
undrinkable. Some kinds of <i>fermentation</i> (the breaking down or
decomposing of organic compounds, usually accompanied by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
formation of gas) are due to these organisms. Other bacteria
oxidize alcohol to <i>acetic acid</i>, and produce <i>lactic acid</i> in milk and
<i>butyric acid</i> in butter. Bacteria live in the mouth, the stomach, the
intestines, and on the surface of the skins of animals. Some secrete
gelatinous sheaths around themselves; others secrete sulphur or
iron, giving the substratum a vivid colour.</p>

<p>Were it not for bacteria, man could not live on the earth, for
not only are they agents in the process of decay, but they are
concerned in certain healthful processes of plants and animals.
We have learned in Chapter VIII how bacteria are related to nitrogen-gathering.</p>

<p>Bacteria are of economic importance not alone because of their
effect on materials used by man, but also because of the <i>disease-producing
power</i> of certain species. <i>Pus</i> is caused by a spherical
form, <i>tetanus</i> or <i>lock-jaw</i> by a rod-shaped form, <i>diphtheria</i> by
short oblong chains, <i>tuberculosis</i> or “<i>consumption</i>” by more slender
oblong chains, and <i>typhoid fever</i>, <i>cholera</i>, and other diseases
by other forms. Many <i>diseases of animals and plants</i> are
caused by bacteria. Disease-producing bacteria are said to be
<i>pathogenic</i>.</p>

<p>The ability to grow in other nutrient substances than the natural
one has greatly facilitated the study of these minute forms
of life. By the use of suitable culture media and proper precautions,
<i>pure cultures</i> of a particular disease-producing bacterium
may be obtained with which further experiments may be conducted.</p>

<p>Milk provides an excellent collecting place for bacteria coming
from the air, from the coat of the cow and from the milker. Disease
germs are sometimes carried in milk. If a drop of milk is
spread on a culture medium (as agar), and provided with proper
temperature, the bacteria will multiply, each one forming a colony
visible to the naked eye. In this way, the number of bacteria
originally contained in the milk may be counted.</p>

<p>Bacteria are disseminated in water, as the germ of typhoid fever
and cholera; in milk and other fluids; in the air; and on the
bodies of flies, feet of birds, and otherwise.</p>

<p>Bacteria are thought by many to have descended from algæ by
the loss of chlorophyll and decrease in size due to the more
specialized acquired saprophytic and parasitic habit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Algæ</span></h3>

<p>The algæ comprise most of the green floating “scum” which
covers the surfaces of ponds and other quiet waters. The masses
of plants are often called “frog spittle.” Others are attached to
stones, pieces of wood, and other objects submerged in streams<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
and lakes, and many are found on moist ground and on dripping
rocks. Aside from these, all the plants commonly known as seaweeds
belong to this category; these latter are inhabitants of salt water.</p>

<p>The simplest forms of algæ consist of a single spherical cell,
which multiplies by repeated division or fission. Many of the
forms found in fresh water are filamentous, <i>i.e.</i> the plant body
consists of long threads, either simple or branched. Such a plant
body is termed a <i>thallus</i>. This term applies to the vegetative
body of all plants that are <i>not differentiated into stem and leaves</i>.
Such plants are known as <i>thallophytes</i> (p. <a href="#Page_181">181</a>). All algæ contain
chlorophyll, and are able to assimilate carbon dioxide from the air.
This distinguishes them from the fungi.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Nostoc.</i>—On wet rocks and damp soil dark, semitransparent
irregular or spherical gelatinous masses about the size of a pea are
often found. These consist of a colony of contorted filamentous
algæ embedded in the jelly-like mass. The chain of cells in the
filament is necklace-like. Each cell is homogeneous, without
apparent nucleus, and blue-green in colour, except one cell which
is larger and clearer than the rest. The plant therefore belongs
to the group of <i>blue-green algæ</i>. The jelly probably serves to
maintain a more even moisture and to provide mechanical protection.
Multiplication is wholly by the breaking
up of the threads. Occasionally certain cells
of the filament thicken to become <i>resting-spores</i>,
but no other spore formation occurs.</p>

found on damp soil and in water frequently
show under the microscope the presence of
filamentous algæ composed of many short
homogeneous cells (Fig. <a href="#fig264">264</a>). If watched
closely, some filaments will be seen to wave
back and forth slowly, showing a peculiar power

threads. There is no true spore formation.</p>

plant often forms the greater part of the floating green mass (or
“frog spittle”) on ponds. The thread-like character of the thallus
can be seen with the naked eye or with a hand
lens, but to study it carefully a microscope
magnifying two hundred diameters or more
must be used. The thread is divided into long
cells by cross walls which, according to the
species, are either straight or curiously folded
(Fig. <a href="#fig266">266</a>). The chlorophyll is arranged in
<i>beautiful spiral bands</i> near the wall of each cell.
From the character of these bands the plant
takes its name. Each cell is provided with a
<i>nucleus</i> and other <i>protoplasm</i>. The nucleus is
suspended near the centre of the cell (<i>a</i>, Fig.
<a href="#fig265">265</a>) by delicate strands of protoplasm radiating
toward the wall and terminating at certain
points in the chlorophyll band. The remainder
of the protoplasm forms a thin layer lining the
wall. The interior of the cell is filled with

</figure>

<p>Spirogyra is propagated vegetatively by the
breaking off of parts of the threads, which continue
to grow as new plants. Resting-spores,
which may remain dormant for a time, are formed by a process
known as <i>conjugation</i>. Two threads lying side
by side send out short projections, usually from
all the cells of a long series (Fig. <a href="#fig266">266</a>). The
projections or processes from opposite cells
grow toward each other, meet, and fuse, forming
a connecting tube between the cells. The
protoplasm, nucleus, and chlorophyll band of
one cell now pass through this tube, and unite
with the contents of the other cell. The entire
mass then becomes surrounded by a thick
cellulose wall, thus completing the <i>resting-spore</i>,
or <i>zygospore</i> (<i>z</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig266">266</a>).</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Zygnema</i> is an alga closely related to spirogyra
and found in similar places. Its life
history is practically the same, but it differs
from spirogyra in having <i>two star-shaped
chlorophyll bodies</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig267">267</a>) in each cell, instead
of a chlorophyll-bearing spiral band.</p>

<p><i>Vaucheria</i> is another alga common in shallow water and on
damp soil. The thallus is much branched, but the threads are
not divided by cross walls as in spirogyra. The plants are attached
by means of colourless root-like organs which are much like the
root-hairs of the higher plants: these are <i>rhizoids</i>. The chlorophyll
is in the form of <i>grains scattered through the thread</i>.</p>

<p>Vaucheria has a special mode of asexual reproduction by
means of swimming spores or <i>swarm-spores</i>. These are formed
singly in a short enlarged lateral branch known as the <i>sporangium</i>.
When the sporangium bursts, the entire contents escape, forming
a single large swarm-spore, which swims about by means of
numerous lashes or cilia on its surface. The swarm-spores are so
large that they can be seen with the naked eye. After swimming
about for some time they come to rest and germinate, producing
a new plant.</p>

<i>antheridia</i> (<i>a</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig268">268</a>).
These are both specially developed branches from the thallus. The
antheridia are nearly cylindrical, and curved toward the oögonia.
The upper part of an antheridium is cut off by a cross wall, and
within it numerous ciliated <i>sperm-cells</i> are formed. These
escape by the ruptured apex of the antheridium. The oögonia are
more enlarged than the antheridia, and have a beak-like projection
turned a little to one side of the apex. They are separated from the
thallus thread by a cross wall, and contain a single large green
cell, the <i>egg-cell</i>. The apex of the oögonium is dissolved,
and through the opening the sperm-cells enter. Fertilization is thus
accomplished. After fertilization the egg-cell becomes invested
with a thick wall and is thus converted into a resting-spore, the
<i>oöspore</i>.</p>

are firm and strong to resist wave action and are so attached as to
avoid being washed ashore. They are very abundant algæ. In
shape the plants are long, branched, and multicellular, with either
flat or terete branches. They are olive-brown. Propagation is by
the breaking off of the branches. No zoöspores are produced,
as in many other seaweeds; and reproduction is wholly sexual.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fungi</span></h3>

<p>Some forms of fungi are familiar to every one. Mushrooms
and toadstools, with their varied forms and colours, are common
in fields, woods, and pastures. In every household the common
moulds are familiar intruders, appearing on old bread, vegetables,
and even within tightly sealed fruit jars, where they form a felt-like
layer dusted over with blue, yellow, or black powder. The
strange occurrence of these plants long mystified people, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
thought they were productions of the dead matter upon which they
grew, but now we know that a mould, as any other plant, cannot
originate spontaneously; it must start from something which is
analogous to a seed. The “seed” <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: is" id="is">in</ins> this case is a <i>spore</i>. A spore
may be produced by a <i>vegetative process</i> (growing out from the
ordinary plant tissues), or it may be the result of a <i>fertilization
process</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Favourable conditions for the growth of fungi.</i>—Place a piece
of bread under a moist bell jar and another in an uncovered
place near by. Sow mould on each. Note the result from day to
day. Moisten a third piece of bread with weak copper sulphate
(blue vitriol) or mercuric chloride solution,
sow mould, cover with bell jar, note results,
and explain. Expose pieces of different kinds
of food in a damp atmosphere and observe
the variety of organisms appearing. Fungi
are saprophytes or parasites, and must be
provided with organic matter on which to
grow. They are usually most abundant in
moist places and wet seasons.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 271.—Mucor
mucedo</span>, showing habit.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>Mould.</i>—One of these moulds (<i>Mucor mucedo</i>),
which is very common on all decaying
fruits and vegetables, is shown in Fig.
<a href="#fig271">271</a>, somewhat magnified. When fruiting, this mould appears as a
<i>dense mass of long white hairs</i>, often over an inch high, standing
erect from the fruit or the vegetable on which it is growing.</p>

<p>The life of this mucor begins with a minute rounded spore
(<i>a</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig272">272</a>), which lodges on the decaying material. When the
spore germinates, it sends out a delicate thread that grows rapidly
in length and forms very many branches that
soon permeate every part of the substance on
which the plant grows (<i>b</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig272">272</a>). One of
these threads is termed a <i>hypha</i>. All the
threads together form the <i>mycelium</i> of the
fungus. The mycelium disorganizes the material
in which it grows, and thus the mucor
plant (Fig. <a href="#fig271">271</a>) is nourished. It corresponds
physiologically to the roots and the stems of
other plants.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="fig272">

<figcaption class="caption caphang"><span class="smcap">Fig.
272.—Spores of Mucor</span>, some germinating. </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When the mycelium is about two days old, it begins to form the
long fruiting stalks which we first noticed. To study them, use a
compound microscope magnifying about two hundred diameters.
One of the stalks, magnified, is shown in <i>a</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig274">274</a>. It consists
of a rounded head, the <i>sporangium</i>, <i>sp</i>, supported on a long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
delicate stalk, the <i>sporangiophore</i>. The stalk is separated from
the sporangium by a wall which is formed at the base of the sporangium.
This wall, however, does not
extend straight across the thread, but it
arches up into the sporangium like an
inverted pear. It is known as the <i>columella</i>,
<i>c</i>. When the sporangium is
placed in water, the wall immediately
dissolves and allows hundreds of spores,
which were formed in the cavity within
the sporangium, to escape, <i>b</i>. All that
is left of the fruit is the stalk, with the
pear-shaped columella at its summit, <i>c</i>.
The spores that have been set free by the
breaking of the sporangium wall are now
scattered by the wind and other agents.
Those that lodge in favourable places begin
to grow immediately and reproduce
the fungus. The others soon perish.</p>

</figure>

<p>The mucor may continue to reproduce itself in this way indefinitely,
but these spores are very delicate and
usually die if they do not fall on favourable
ground, so that the fungus is provided with
another means of carrying itself over unfavourable
seasons, as winter. This is accomplished
by means of curious <i>thick-walled resting-spores</i>
or <i>zygospores</i>. The zygospores are formed on
the mycelium buried within the substance on
which the plant grows. They originate in the
following way: Two threads that lie near together
send out short branches, which grow
toward each other and finally meet (Fig. <a href="#fig273">273</a>).
The walls at the ends, <i>a</i>, then disappear, allowing
the contents to flow together. At the same
time, however, two other walls are formed at
points farther back, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, separating the short
section, <i>c</i>, from the remainder of the thread.
This section now increases in size and becomes
covered with a thick, dark brown wall ornamented
with thickened tubercles. The zygospore
is now mature and, after a period of
rest, it germinates, either producing a sporangium
directly or growing out as mycelium.</p>

<p>The zygospores of the mucors form one of the most interesting
and instructive objects among the lower plants. They are, however,
very difficult to obtain. One of the mucors (<i>Sporodinia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
grandis</i>) may be frequently found in summer growing on toadstools.
This plant usually produces zygospores that are formed
on the aërial mycelium. The zygospores are large enough to be
recognized with a hand lens. The material may be dried and
kept for winter study, or the zygospores may be prepared for
permanent microscopic mounts in the ordinary way.</p>

<p><i>Yeast.</i>—This is a very much reduced and simple fungus, consisting
normally of isolated spherical or elliptical cells (Fig. <a href="#fig275">275</a>)
containing abundant protoplasm and probably
a nucleus, although the latter is not
easily observed. It propagates rapidly by
<i>budding</i>, which consists of the gradual extrusion
of a wart-like swelling that is sooner or
later cut off at the base by constriction, thus
forming a separate organism. Although simple
in structure, the yeast is found to be
closely related to some of the higher groups of
fungi as shown by the method of spore formation.
When grown on special substances like potato or carrot, the
contents of the cell may <i>form spores inside of the sac-like mother
cell</i>, thus resembling the sac-fungi to which blue mould and mildews
belong. The yeast plant is remarkable on account of its power to
induce alcoholic fermentation in the media in which it grows.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 275.—Yeast
Plants.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are many kinds of yeasts. One of them is found in the
common <i>yeast cakes</i>. In the process of manufacture of these
cakes, the yeast cells grow to a certain stage, and the material is
then dried and fashioned into small cakes, each cake containing
great numbers of the yeast cells. When the yeast cake is added
to dough, and proper conditions of warmth and moisture are provided,
the yeast grows rapidly and breaks up the sugar of the
dough into carbon dioxide and alcohol. This is <i>fermentation</i>.
The gases escape and puff up the dough, causing the <i>bread to rise</i>.
In this loosened condition the dough is baked; if it is not baked
quickly enough, <i>the bread</i> “<i>falls</i>.” Shake up a bit of yeast cake
in slightly sweetened water: the water soon becomes cloudy from
the growing yeasts.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Parasitic fungi.</i>—Most of the moulds are saprophytes. Many
other fungi are parasitic on living plants and animals (Fig. <a href="#fig285">285</a>).
Some of them have complicated life histories, undergoing many
changes before the original spore is again produced. The <i>willow
mildew</i> and the common <i>rust of wheat</i> will serve to illustrate the
habits of parasitic fungi.</p>

<p>The <i>willow mildew</i> (<i>Uncinula salicis</i>).—This is one of the sac
fungi. It forms white downy patches on the leaves of willows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
(Fig. <a href="#fig276">276</a>). These patches consist of numerous interwoven
threads that may be recognized under the microscope as the
mycelium of the fungus.
The mycelium in this
case lives on the surface
of the leaf and nourishes
itself by sending
short branches into the
cells of the leaf to absorb
food materials from
them.</p>

<p>Numerous <i>summer-spores</i> are formed of short, erect branches all
over the white surface. One of these branches is shown in Fig.
<a href="#fig277">277</a>. When it has grown to a certain
length, the upper part begins
to segment or divide into spores
which fall and are scattered by the
wind. Those falling on other willows
reproduce the fungus there.
This process continues all summer,
but in the later part of the season
provision is made to maintain the
mildew through the winter. If some
of the white patches are closely examined
in July or August, a number
of little black bodies will be seen among the threads. These little
bodies are called <i>perithecia</i>, shown in Fig. <a href="#fig278">278</a>. To the naked eye
they appear as minute specks,
but when seen under a magnification
of 200 diameters they
present a very interesting appearance.
They are hollow spherical
bodies decorated around
the outside
with a fringe
of crook-like
hairs. The
<i>resting-spores</i>
of the willow
mildew are
produced in
sacs or <i>asci</i> inclosed

the leathery
perithecia. Figure 279 shows a cross-section of a perithecium
with the asci arising from the bottom. The spores remain securely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
packed in the perithecia. They do not ripen in the autumn, but
fall to the ground with the leaf, and there remain securely protected
among the dead foliage. The following spring they mature
and are liberated by the decay of the perithecia. They are then
ready to attack the unfolding leaves of the willow and repeat the
work of the summer before.</p>

<p><i>The wheat rust.</i>—The development of some of the rusts, as the
common <i>wheat rust</i> (<i>Puccinia graminis</i>), is even more interesting
and complicated than that of the
mildews. Wheat rust is also a true
parasite, affecting wheat and a few
other grasses. The mycelium here
cannot be seen by the unaided eye,
for it consists of threads which are
present within the host plant, mostly
in the intercellular spaces. These
threads also send short branches, or
<i>haustoria</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig132">132</a>), into the neighbouring
cells to absorb nutriment.</p>

<p>The <i>resting-spores</i> of wheat rust
are produced in late summer, when
they may be found in black lines
breaking through the epidermis of
the wheat stalk (black-rust stage).
They are formed in masses, called
<i>sori</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig280">280</a>), from the ends of
numerous crowded mycelial strands just beneath the epidermis of
the host. The individual spores are very small and can be well
studied only with a microscope of high power
(× about 400). They are brown two-celled bodies
with a thick wall (Fig. <a href="#fig281">281</a>). Since they are
the resting or winter-spores, they are termed <i>teleutospores</i>
(“completed spores”). Usually they do
not fall, but remain in the sori during winter.
The following spring each cell of the teleutospore
puts forth a rather stout thread, which does not
grow more than several times the length of the
spore and terminates in a blunt extremity. This
germ tube, <i>promycelium</i>, now becomes divided
into four cells by cross walls, which are formed
from the top downwards. Each cell gives rise to a short, pointed
branch which, in the course of a few hours, forms at its summit
a single spore called a <i>sporidium</i>. This in turn germinates and
produces a mycelium. In Fig.<a href="#fig282"> 282</a> a germinating teleutospore
is drawn to show the promycelium, <i>p</i>, divided into four cells,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>

</figure>
<p>A most remarkable circumstance in the life
history of the wheat rust is the fact that the mycelium
produced by the sporidium <i>can live only
in barberry leaves</i>, and it follows that if no barberry
bushes are in the neighbourhood the sporidia
finally perish. Those which happen to lodge on
a barberry bush germinate immediately, producing
a mycelium that enters the barberry leaf and
grows within its tissues. Very soon the fungus
produces a new kind of spores on the barberry
leaves. These are called <i>æcidiospores</i>. They are
formed in long chains in little fringed cups, or
<i>æcidia</i>, which appear in groups on the lower side
of the leaf (Fig. <a href="#fig283">283</a>). These orange or yellow
æcidia are termed <i>cluster-cups</i>. In Fig. <a href="#fig284">284</a> is
shown a cross-section of one of the cups, outlining
the long chains of spores, and the mycelium in the tissues.</p>

</figure>

<p>The æcidiospores are formed in the spring, and after they have
been set free, some of them lodge on wheat or other grasses,
where they germinate immediately. The germ-tube enters the
leaf through a stomate, whence it spreads among the cells of the
wheat plant. In summer one-celled reddish <i>uredospores</i> (“blight
spores,” red-rust stage) are produced in a manner similar to the
teleutospores. These are capable of germinating immediately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
and serve to disseminate the fungus during the summer on other
wheat plants or grasses. Late in the season, teleutospores are
again produced, completing the life cycle of the plant.</p>

<p>Many rusts besides <i>Puccinia graminis</i> produce different spore
forms on different plants. The phenomenon is called <i>heterœcism</i>,
and was first shown to exist in the wheat rust. Curiously enough,
the peasants of Europe had observed and asserted that barberry
bushes cause wheat to blight long before science explained the
relation between the cluster-cups on barberry and the rust on
wheat. The true relation was actually demonstrated, as has since
been done for many other rusts on their respective hosts, by sowing
the æcidiospores on healthy wheat plants and thus producing
the rust. The <i>cedar apple</i> is another rust, producing the curious
swellings often found on the branches of red cedar trees. In the
spring the teleutospores ooze out from the “apple” in brownish
yellow masses. It has been found that these attack various
fruit trees, producing æcidia on their leaves. Fig. <a href="#fig285">285</a> explains
how a parasitic fungus works.</p>

only ones which we ordinarily see, and which constitute the “mushroom”
part (Fig. <a href="#fig131">131</a>).
Only asexual spores (<i>basidiospores</i>)
are produced,
and on short stalks (<i>basidia</i>)
(Fig. <a href="#fig286">286</a>). In the puff-balls
the spores are inclosed
and constitute a large part
of the “smoke.” In the
mushrooms and toadstools
they are borne on <i>gills</i>, and
in the shelf fungi (Fig. <a href="#fig134">134</a>)
on the walls of minute pores
of the underside. The mycelium
of these shelf fungi
frequently lives and grows
for a long time concealed in
the substratum before the
visible fruit bodies are sent
out. Practically all timber
decay is caused by such
growth, and the damage is
largely done before the fruiting bodies appear. For other accounts
of mushrooms, see Chapter XIV.</p>

<p>Lichens are so common everywhere
that the attention of the student is sure
to be drawn to them. They grow on
rocks, trunks of trees (Fig. <a href="#fig287">287</a>), old
fences, and on the earth. They are
thin, usually gray ragged objects, apparently
lifeless. Their study is too
difficult for beginners, but a few words
of explanation may be useful.</p>

<p>Lichens were formerly supposed to
be a distinct or separate division of
plants. They are now known to be organisms,
each species of which is a constant
association of a fungus and an alga.
The thallus is ordinarily made up of fungous
mycelium or tissue within which
the imprisoned alga is definitely distributed.
The result is a growth unlike
either component. This association of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
alga and fungus is usually spoken of as <i>symbiosis</i>, or mutually
helpful growth, the alga furnishing some things, the fungus others,
and both together being able to accomplish work that neither
could do independently. By others this union is considered to
be a mild form of parasitism, in which the fungus profits at the
expense of the alga. As favourable to this view, the facts are cited
that each component is able to grow independently, and that under
such conditions the algal cells seem to thrive better than when
imprisoned by the fungus.</p>

<p>Lichens propagate by means of <i>soredia</i>, which are tiny parts
separated from the body of the thallus, and consisting of one or
more algal cells overgrown with fungus threads. These are readily
observed in many lichens. They also produce spores, usually
ascospores, which are always the product of the fungus element,
and which reproduce the lichen by germinating in the presence of
algal cells, to which the hyphæ immediately cling.</p>

<p>Lichens are found in the most inhospitable places, and, by
means of acids which they secrete, they attack and slowly disintegrate
even the hardest rocks. By making thin sections of the
thallus with a sharp razor and examining under the compound
microscope, it is easy to distinguish the two components in many
lichens.</p>

</figure>

<p>The liverworts are peculiar flat green plants usually found
on wet cliffs and in other moist, shady places. They frequently
occur in greenhouses where the soil is kept constantly wet.
One of the commonest liverworts is <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>,
two plants of which are shown in Figs. <a href="#fig288_289">288, 289</a>. The plant
consists of a ribbon-like thallus that creeps along the ground,
becoming repeatedly forked as it grows. The end of each branch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
is always conspicuously notched. There is a prominent midrib
extending along the centre of each branch of the thallus. On the
under side of the thallus, especially along the midrib, there are
numerous rhizoids which serve the purpose of roots, absorbing
nourishment from the earth and
holding the plant in its place. The
upper surface of the thallus is divided
into minute rhombic areas
that can be seen with the naked
eye. Each of these areas is perforated
by a small breathing pore
or stomate that leads into a cavity
just beneath the epidermis. This
space is surrounded by chlorophyll-bearing
cells, some of which stand
in rows from the bottom of the
cavity (Fig. <a href="#fig290">290</a>). The delicate
assimilating tissue is thus brought in close communication with the
outer air through the pore in the thick, protecting epidermis.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 290.—Section of Thallus
of Marchantia.</span> Stomate at <i>a</i>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At various points on the midrib are little cups containing
small green bodies. These bodies are buds or <i>gemmæ</i> which are
outgrowths from the cells at the bottom of the cup. They become
loosened and are then dispersed by the rain to other places, where
they take root and grow into new plants.</p>

<p>The most striking organs on the thallus of marchantia are the
peculiar stalked bodies shown in Figs.<a href="#fig288_289"> 288, 289</a>. These are
termed <i>archegoniophores</i> and <i>antheridiophores</i> or <i>receptacles</i>. Their
structure and function are very interesting, but their parts are so
minute that they can be studied only with the aid of a microscope
magnifying from 100 to 400 times. Enlarged drawings will guide
the pupil.</p>

</figure>

<p>The <i>antheridiophores</i> are fleshy, lobed disks borne on short stalks
(Fig. <a href="#fig291">291</a>). The upper surface of the disk shows openings scarcely
visible to the naked eye. However, a section of the disk, such as
is drawn in Fig. <a href="#fig291">291</a>, shows that the pores lead into oblong cavities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
in the receptacle. From the base of each cavity there arises
a thick, club-shaped body, the <i>antheridium</i>. Within the antheridium
are formed many sperm-cells which are capable
of swimming about in water by means of long
lashes or cilia attached to them. When the antheridium
is mature, it bursts and allows the ciliated
sperm cells to escape.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 292.—Archegonium

</figure>

<p>The <i>archegoniophores</i> are also elevated on stalks
(Fig. <a href="#fig288_289">289</a>). Instead of a simple disk, the receptacle
consists of nine or more finger-like rays. Along
the under side of the rays, between delicately
fringed curtains, peculiar flask-like bodies, or <i>archegonia</i>,
are situated. The archegonia are not visible
to the naked eye. They can be studied only with
the microscope (x about 400). One of them
much magnified is represented in Fig. <a href="#fig292">292</a>. Its
principal parts are the long <i>neck</i>, <i>a</i>, and the
rounded <i>venter</i>, <i>b</i>, inclosing a large free cell—the
egg-cell.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp30" id="fig293">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 293.—Archegoniophore,

</figure>

<p>We have seen that the antheridium at maturity discharges its
sperm-cells. These swim about in the water provided by the dew
and rain. Some of them finally find their way
to the archegonia and egg-cells, the latter
being fertilized, as pollen fertilizes the ovules
of higher plants.</p>

<p>After fertilization the egg-cell develops into
the spore capsule or <i>sporogonium</i>. The mature
spore capsules may be seen in Fig. <a href="#fig293">293</a>. They
consist of an oval spore-case on a short stalk,
the base of which is imbedded in the tissue of
the receptacle, from which it derives the necessary
nourishment for the development of the
sporogonium. At maturity the sporogonium
is ruptured at the apex, setting free the spherical
spores together with numerous filaments
having spirally thickened walls (Fig. <a href="#fig294">294</a>). These filaments are
called <i>elaters</i>. When drying, they exhibit rapid movements by
means of which the spores are scattered. The spores germinate
and again produce the thallus of marchantia.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mosses</span> (Bryophyta)</h3>

<div class="capsml"><i>f</i>, <i>f</i>, fertile plants, one on the left in fruit;
<i>m</i>, antheridial plant.</div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If we have followed carefully the development of marchantia,
the study of one of the mosses will be comparatively easy. The
mosses are more familiar plants than the liverworts.
They grow on trees, stones, and on the
soil in both wet and dry places. One of the
common larger mosses, known as <i>Polytrichum
commune</i>, may serve as an
example, Fig. <a href="#fig295">295</a>. This plant
grows on rather dry knolls,
mostly in the borders of open
woods, where it forms large
beds. In dry weather these
beds have a reddish brown
appearance, but when moist
they form beautiful green
cushions. This colour is due,
in the first instance, to the
colour of the old stems and
leaves, and, in the second instance,
to the peculiar action
of the green living leaves
under the influence of changing
moisture-conditions. The
inner or upper surface of the
leaf is covered with thin, longitudinal
ridges of delicate
cells which contain chlorophyll.
These cells are shown
in cross-section in Fig. <a href="#fig296">296</a>, as dots or granules. All the other
tissue of the leaf consists of thick-walled, corky cells which do
not allow moisture to penetrate. When the air is moist the green
leaves spread out, exposing the chlorophyll cells to the air, but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
dry weather the margins of the leaves roll inward, and the leaves
fold closely against the stem, thus protecting the delicate assimilating
tissue.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="fig296">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig296.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 296.—Section of Leaf of Polytrichum commune.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <i>antheridia</i> and <i>archegonia</i> of polytrichum are borne in
groups at the ends of the branches on different plants (many
mosses bear both organs on the same branch). They are surrounded
by involucres of characteristic leaves termed <i>perichætia</i>
or <i>perichætal leaves</i>. Multicellular hairs known as <i>paraphyses</i> are
scattered among the archegonia and antheridia. The involucres
with the organs borne within them are called <i>receptacles</i>, or, less
appropriately, “moss flowers.” As in marchantia, the organs are
very minute and must be highly magnified to be studied.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp40" id="fig297">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig297.jpg" alt="">
 <figcaption class="caption caphang"><span class="smcap">Fig.
297.—Section through a Receptacle of Polytrichum commune</span>,
showing paraphyses and antheridia. </figcaption>

</figure>

<p>The antheridia are borne in broad cup-like receptacles on the
antheridial plants (Fig. <a href="#fig297">297</a>). They are much like the antheridia
of marchantia, but they stand free
among the paraphyses and are not
sunk in cavities. At maturity they
burst and allow the sperm-cells or
<i>spermatozoids</i> to escape. In polytrichum,
when the receptacles have
fulfilled their function, the stem continues
to grow from the centre of
the cup (<i>m</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig295">295</a>). The archegonia
are borne in other receptacles
on different plants. They are like
the archegonia of marchantia except that they stand erect on the
end of the branch.</p>

<p>The <i>sporogonium</i> which develops from the fertilized egg is
shown in <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig295">295</a>. It consists of a long, brown stalk bearing
the spore-case at its summit. The base of the stalk is imbedded
in the end of the moss stem by which it is nourished. The
capsule is entirely inclosed by a hairy cap, the <i>calyptra</i>, <i>b</i>. The
calyptra is really the remnant of the archegonium, which, for a
time, increases in size to accommodate and protect the young
growing capsule. It is finally torn loose and carried up on the
spore-case. The mouth of the capsule is closed by a circular lid,
the <i>operculum</i>, having a conical projection at the centre.</p>

<p>The operculum soon drops, or it may be removed, displaying a
fringe of sixty-four teeth guarding the mouth of the capsule. This
ring of teeth is known as the <i>peristome</i>. In most mosses the
teeth exhibit peculiar hygroscopic movements; <i>i.e.</i> when moist
they bend outwards, and upon drying curve in toward the mouth
of the capsule. This motion, it will be seen, serves to disperse
these spores gradually over a long period of time.</p>

<p>Not the entire capsule is filled with spores. There are no
elaters, but the centre of the capsule is occupied by a columnar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
strand of tissue, the <i>columella</i>, which expands at the mouth into a
thin, membranous disk, closing the entire mouth of the capsule
except the narrow annular chink guarded by the
teeth. In this moss the points of the teeth are
attached to the margin of the membrane, allowing
the spores to sift out through the spaces between
them.</p>

<p>When the spores germinate they form a green,
branched thread, the <i>protonema</i>. This gives rise
directly to moss plants, which appear as little
buds on the thread. When the moss plants have
sent their little rhizoids into the earth, the protonema
dies, for it is no longer necessary for the
support of the little plants, and the moss plants
grow independently.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption caphang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 298.—Funaria
hygroscopica.</span>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>Funaria</i> is a moss very common on damp,
open soil. It forms green patches of small fine
leaves from which arise long brown stalks terminated
by curved capsules (Fig. <a href="#fig298">298</a>). The structure
is similar to that of polytrichum, except the
absence of plates on the under side of the leaves,
the continuous growth of the stem, the curved
capsule, double peristome, monœcious rather than diœcious receptacles,
and nearly glabrous unsymmetrical calyptra.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Equisetums, or Horsetails</span> (Pteridophyta)</h3>

<p>There are about twenty-five species of equisetum, constituting
the only genus of the unique family <i>Equisetaceæ</i>. Among these
<i>E. arvense</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig299">299</a>) is common on clayey and sandy soils.</p>

<p>In this species the work of nutrition and that of spore
production are performed by separate shoots from an underground
rhizome. The fertile branches appear early in spring. The stem,
which is 3 to 6 inches high, consists of a number of cylindrical,
furrowed internodes, each sheathed at the base by a circle of scale
leaves. The shoots are of a pale yellow colour. They contain no
chlorophyll, and are nourished by the food stored in the rhizome
(Fig. <a href="#fig299">299</a>).</p>

<p>The spores are formed on specially developed fertile leaves or
<i>sporophylls</i> which are collected into a spike or cone at the end of
the stalk (<i>a</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig299">299</a>). A single sporophyll is shown at <i>b</i>. It
consists of a short stalk expanded into a broad, mushroom-like
head. Several large <i>sporangia</i> are borne on its under side. The
spores formed in the sporangia are very interesting and beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
objects when examined under the microscope (× about 200).
They are spherical, green bodies, each surrounded by two spiral
bands attached to the spore at their intersection, <i>s</i>. These bands
exhibit hygroscopic movements by means of which the spores become
entangled, and are held together. This is of advantage to the
plant, as we shall see. All the spores are alike, but some of the <i>prothallia</i>
grow to a greater size than the others. The large prothallia
produce only <i>archegonia</i> while the smaller ones produce <i>antheridia</i>.
Both these organs are much like those of the ferns, and fertilization
is accomplished in the same way. Since the prothallia are
usually diœcious, the special advantage of the spiral bands, holding
the spores together so that both kinds of prothallia may be in
close proximity, will be easily understood. As in the fern, the
fertilized egg-cell develops into an equisetum plant.</p>

<i>f</i>, fertile shoot showing the spike at <i>a</i>; <i>b</i>,

</figure>

<p>The sterile shoots (<i>st</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig299">299</a>) appear much later in the season.
They give rise to repeated whorls of angular or furrowed branches.
The leaves are very much reduced scales, situated at the internodes.
The stems are provided with chlorophyll and act as
assimilating tissue, nourishing the rhizome and the fertile shoots.
Nutriment is also stored in special tubers developed on the rhizome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span></p>

<p>Other species of equisetum have only one kind of shoot—a tall,
hard, leafless, green shoot with the spike at its summit. Equisetum
stems are full of silex, and they are sometimes used for scouring
floors and utensils; hence the common name “scouring rush.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Isoëtes</span> (Pteridophyta)</h3>

<p><i>Isoëtes</i> or quillwort is usually found in water or damp soil on
the edges of ponds and lakes. The general habit of the plant is
seen in Fig. <a href="#fig300">300</a>, <i>a</i>. It consists
of a short, perennial stem bearing
numerous erect, quill-like
leaves with broad sheathing bases.
The plants are commonly mistaken
for young grasses.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp40" id="fig300">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig300.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption caphang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 300.—Isoëtes</span>, showing habit
of plant at <i>a</i>; <i>b</i>, base of leaf, showing
sporangium, velum, and ligule.
</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Isoëtes bears two kinds of
spores, large roughened ones,
the <i>macrospores</i>, and small ones
or <i>microspores</i>. Both kinds are
formed in <i>sporangia</i> borne in an
excavation in the expanded base
of the leaf. The macrospores are
formed on the outer and the
microspores on the inner leaves.
A sporangium in the base of a
leaf is shown at <i>b</i>. It is partially
covered by a thin membrane,
the <i>velum</i>. The minute triangular
appendage at the upper end
of the sporangium is called the
<i>ligule</i>.</p>

<p>The spores are liberated by
the decay of the sporangia. They
form rudimentary prothallia of two
kinds. The microspores produce
prothallia with <i>antheridia</i>, while
the macrospores produce prothallia
with <i>archegonia</i>. Fertilization
takes place as in the mosses or liverworts, and the fertilized
egg-cell, by continued growth, gives rise again to the isoëtes plant.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Club-Mosses</span> (Pteridophyta)</h3>

<p>The club-mosses are low trailing plants of moss-like looks and
habit, although more closely allied to ferns than to true mosses.
Except one genus in Florida, all the club-mosses belong to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
genus <i>Lycopodium</i>. They grow mostly in woods, having 1-nerved
evergreen leaves arranged in four or more ranks. Some of them
make long strands, as the ground pine, and are much used for
Christmas decorations. The spores are all <i>of one kind</i> or form,
borne in <i>1-celled sporangia</i> that open on the margin into <i>two
valves</i>. The sporangia are borne in some species (Fig. <a href="#fig301">301</a>)
as small yellow bodies in the axils of the ordinary leaves near the
tip of the shoot; in other species (Fig. <a href="#fig302">302</a>) they are borne
in the axils of small scales that form a catkin-like spike. The
spores are very numerous, and they contain an oil that makes them
inflammable. About 100 species of lycopodium are known.
The plants grown by florists under the name of lycopodium are
of the genus <i>Selaginella</i>, more closely allied to isoëtes, bearing
two kinds of spores (microspores and macrospores).</p>
